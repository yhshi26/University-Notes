# Review: L1-16
###### tags: `GPRS20010 - systems`

## L1: Communication skills 
### Statistics
- 54% of problems and 45% of concerns are neither discovered by the doctor or disclosed by the patient
- 50% of phsychosocial and psychiatric problems are missed
- doctors interrupt patients after 18 seconds
- doctors and patients disagree on the presenting complaint 50% of the time
- 10% of patients do not understand what they have been told by their doctor

### Consultation models
- 1984 Pendleton et al: the Consultation
    - **ideas, concerns, expectations**
- 1996 Kurtz and Silverman: **the Calgary-Cambridge Observation Guide to Consultation**
    - initiate session → gather information → physical exam → explain and plan → close session
    - from beginning to end, provide structure and build relationship

## L2: Determinants of health
### What factors determine health?
- health: "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity" (WHO)
- non-modifiable risks: age, sex and hereditary factors
    - age associated with higher rates of illness
    - men have lower life expectancy
    - 2% of liveborn babies have significant congenital malformations, 5% have genetic disorders

### What are social determinants of health?
- higher income and social status
- education level
- physical environment
- employment and working conditions
- social support networks
- access to healthcare

### Social deprivation
- can be caused by: 
    1. social class (occupation)
    2. no car
    3. rental accommodation
    4. unemployment

### Education, childhood and health
- many effects of childhood on health include:
    - emotional environment
    - nutrition
    - education
    - exposure to hazards
        - smoke
        - accidents
        - etc.
    - behaviours of parents
        - alcohol
    - social networks
    - local environment
    - healthcare system
        - immunisation
- early childhood education:
    - key role in cognitive and emotional development
    - early childhood education can mitigate social inequalities
    - at age 15, pupils who attended pre-primary education perform better than those who have not

### Where people live...
- positive correlations with:
    - public transportation
    - shops that sell healthy food
    - sidewalks, bike lanes, safe crossings
    - green/blue space
    - far from main road
    - absence of segregation
- negative correlations with:
    - homelessness:
        - people who are homeless (long term) experience higher morbidity and mortality
        - children who experienced homelessness in utero more likely to suffer poor health
    - residential instability:
        - associated with health problems among youth including:
            - early drug use
            - mental health problems
- providing stable housing can improve health and reduce health care costs
    - Housing First model:
        - providing affordable housing decreased Medicaid expenditure by 12%
        - outpatient primary care increased by 20%, ED use declined by 18%

### Where people work...
- in general, having a job is better than having no job for health
    - but job-strain and effort-reward imbalance and phsyical hazards are important
    - from 2007-10, increase in suicide, mental health disorders, drug and alcohol misuse

### Mental and physical health
- people with serious mental illness die, on average, 25 years earlier than general population
    - due to treatable medical conditions caused by modifiable risk factors:
        - smoking
        - obesity
        - substance use
        - inadequate access to medical care

#### Theories of causation

### Inverse care law
- "the principle that the availability of good medical or social care tends to vary inversely with the need of the population served" (Wikipedia)

## Health systems
- the organization of people, institutions, and resources that deliver health care services to meet the health needs of target populations (Wikipedia)

### Dilemmas
- conflict between personal and population health, e.g.:
    1. proprietary vs. generic drugs
    2. indicative rug budgetign
    3. opportunity costs
    4. vaccination programmes

### Framework for systems
- structure: components of a system
- process: what the system does
- outcome: what the system achieves

### Measuring quality
- dimensions of quality:
    1. effectiveness: best available treatment?
    2. efficiency: at best cost?
    3. acceptability: does patient agree?
    4. access: can be accessed when needed?
    5. equity: most in need first?
    6. relevance: community's needs met?

    - demonstrate a commitment to their patients, profession and society through participation in profession led regulation
    - demonstrate a commitment to physician health and sustainable practice
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/FyCYwJ9.png =350x)

## L5: Doctors and professionalism
### History
- systems to ensure that medicine is practised only by qualified and licensed people
- England 1400s: petitions to King to restrict pratice
- England 1500s: Royal College of Physicians 1518
- England 1815: establishes General Medical Council
- Ireland 1927: Medical Registration Council/GMC
- Ireland 1978: Medical Council of Ireland
- Ireland 2007: Medical Practitioners Act 2007

### Why regulate medicine? 
- Rousseau (1762): 
    - The Social Contract argued against the idea that monarchs were divinely empowered to legislate; Rousseau asserts that only the people, who are sovereign, have that all-powerful right
- Moral & political philosophy: 
    - a social contract happens between a government and its people; the people agree to give up some freedoms if the government agrees to protect everyone's rights
- the social contract between doctors and society
    - The implicit understanding that allows doctors a high degree of professional autonomy in return for a commitment to act in the best interests of patients and the welfare of the public (Gough JW. The social contract. 1957)
- professionalism in medicine
    - the means by which doctors fulfill our contract with society

### Medicine is regulated to protect the public
- this involves:
    - educating doctors
    - registration
        - licences
        - limits
    - standards of professional practice
        - ethics
        - the law
    - maintenance of competence
    - accountability
        - fitness to practise

### Principles of medical professionalism
- patients wellfare
- patient autonomy
- social justice

#### Models
- professional self-regulation
    - GMC to 90s
- government agency regulates
    - Eastern Europe to 90s
- lay body supervises
    - Scandinavia
- various roles; various agencies
    - US State Medical Boards

## L6: Challenges in medicine
### Is healthcare a right?
- no constitutional right to healthcare in Ireland
- UN principles 1948, article 25
- Alma-Ata Declaration 1973
- International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966/1989/2012
- new legislation in Ireland: universal health insurance, universal primary care

#### Berlin
- society has a responsibility to its weakest members and will put safety nets in place for them:
    - social welfare
    - unemployment benefits
    - free healthcare

#### Boston
- individuals must provide for themselves according to their means

### UN perspective on health systems
- purposes:
    1. improving health status of individuals, families and communities
    2. defending population against what threatens its health
    3. protecting people against financial consequences of ill-health
    4. providing equitable access to person centred care
    5. making it possible for people to participate in decisions regarding their health and health system
- components:
    1. leadership and governance
    2. health financing
    3. human resources for health
    4. health information systems
    5. essential medical products and technologies
    6. service delivery
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/UtBmMi7.png =350x)

#### Challenges and overriding influences
1. disproportionate focus on specialist curative care
2. fragmentation among competing systems/agencies
3. pervasive commercialisation
4. poor regulation

#### Professional perspective on challenges and overriding influences
1. avoiding burnout/remaining dedicated to medicine
2. time demands of EHR data entry (money)
3. growing number of uncompensated tasks (money)
4. third-party payer interference in patient care (power)
5. managing quality measure incentives/disincentives (money)
6. costs as barriers to patient adherence (money)
7. rapidly changing reimbursement landscapes (money)
8. growing patient disrespect toward physicians (power)
9. remaining independent in a time of value-based care initiatives (power)
10. ever-changing healthcare insurance marketplace (money)

- what do they do?

## L8: Empathy and caring
- empathy: understanding or appreciating how someone else feels including
    - ability to imagine patients emotions and perspectives
    - ability to convey this understanding back to the patient and commitment to help

### How to show care:
- be a healer of people, not a technician for the body
- place yourself in patients position
- attend most basic needs of patients:
    - to be listened to
    - to be comforted
    - to be inspired
