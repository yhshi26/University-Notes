[PCP-CSI Ethics Seminar 2021](https://brightspace.ucd.ie/d2l/le/content/157913/viewContent/1718465/View)

## Principles of medical ethics
- consider principles in medical scenarios:
    1. autonomy
        - capacity = ability to:
            - take in information
            - understand meaning
            - make informed decision based on information
        - assessing capacity:
            - can they understand the information?
            - can they balance/weigh information (alternatives, outcomes, etc.)?
            - can they retain the information as long as needed?
            - can they communicate their decision?
    2. beneficence
    3. non-maleficence
    4. justice

## Irish laws

|          | age |
| -------- | --- | 
| sexual consent | 17 |
| medical, dental, surgical consent | 16 |
| refuse treatment | 18 |
| too young for sexual consent | undefined; re gillick competency |

### Gillick competency
- consider factors such as:
    - child's age, maturity and mental capacity
    - their understanding of the issue and what it involves
        - advantages
        - disadvantages
        - potential long term impacts
    - their understanding of advice given
    - their understanding of alternatives, if available
    - their ability to explain a rationale around their reasoning and decision making
    - (remember that consent is not valid if the young person is pressured or influenced by someone else)
- gillick competency can vary
    - the same child can be gillick competent to make one decision but not another decision

### Mandated reporting
- child engaged in sexual activity under 15
- child aged 15-16 sexual activity with >2 year age difference
    - proximity of age defence (aged 15-6 but <2 year age difference) applies if:
        - agreement was given voluntarily
        - neither party felt exploited or intimidated
        - neither party is in a position of authority
