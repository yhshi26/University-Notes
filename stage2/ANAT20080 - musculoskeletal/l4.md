## The pectoral region:
- region external to the anterior thoracic wall
- anchors upper limb to trunk
- pectoral Muscles
    - movements of pectoral girdle and upper limb
- superficial compartment
    - skin, superficial fascia, breast
- deep compartment
    - muscles and associated neurovascular structure

### Osteology of the bony thorax: underlying bony structure of the pectoral region
- 12 pairs of ribs
- costal cartilages
    - link ribs to sternum
- sternum
- thoracic vertebrae
- intervertebral disks (IV disks)

> anterior and posterior respectively

### Sternum: (can be divided into 3 parts)
- manubrium
    - jugular notch
    - clavicular notches
        - on either side of the jugular notch
- body
    - costal notches
        - attachment points for the costal cartilages
- xiphoid process

    Sternal angle between manubrium and body:
    - manubriosternal joint (angle of louis)
    - juts out, easily palpated - useful landmark
    
    Between body and xiphoid process:
    - xiphisternal joint
    

### Ribs:
- 12 pairs of ribs
    - true ribs
        - 1st-7th ribs
        - directly attached to sternum via costal cartilage
    - false ribs
        - 8th-10th ribs
        - indirectly attach to sternum via costal cartilage of rib above
    - floating ribs
        - 11th & 12th ribs
        - no costal cartilage attachment to sternum

### Pectoralis major: 
- large, fan-shaped superficial muscle covering superior thorax
- 2 heads
    - clavicular Head
        - originates from medial ½ clavicle
    - sternocostal Head
        - large
        - originates from medial parts of anterior thoracic wall
        - lateral border – anterior wall axilla

    **Origin:**
    - medial half of clavicle
    - sternum (anterior surface)
    - upper 7 costal cartilages
    - external oblique aponeurosis
    **Insertion:**
    - lateral lip of intertubercular groove (bicipital groove)
    - muscle fibres with more superior origin:
        - insert lower & more anteriorly on lateral lip than those of inferior origin
    **Innervation:**
    - medial and lateral pectoral nerves
    **Action:**
    - adduction, medial Rotation & flexion of arm at the shoulder joint
        - to test the clavicular head of pectoralis major:
            - abduct arm 90°
            - try to move arm anteriorly against resistance
            - the clavicular head can be seen and palpated
        - to test the sternocostal head of pectoralis major:
            - abduct arm 60°
            - try to adduct arm against resistance
            - if acting normally, the sternocostal head can be seen and palpated
            
### Pectoralis minor:
**Origin:**
- surfaces of ribs 3,4,5
**Insertion:** 
- coracoid process of scpaula
**Innervation:**
- medial pectoral nerve
**Action:**
- draws scapula forward and down
- assists in raising ribs during inspiration

### Serratus anterior:
**Origin:**
- external lateral surfaces of ribs 1-8 or 1-9
**Insertion:**
- anterior surface of the medial border of the scapula
**Innervation:**
- long thoracic nerve
**Action:**
- fixes scapula against the thoracic wall
- assists in lateral rotation of the scapula allowing arm to be raised over 90 degrees

> **winged scapula:** most common cause of scapular winging is paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle due to the injury of the long thoracic nerve

### Subclavius:
**Origin:**
- junction of 1st rib and its costal cartilage
**Insertion:**
- subclavian groove of clavicle
**Innervation:**
- nerve to subclavius
**Action:**
- draws clavicle down & forward
- stabilises sternoclavicular joint
