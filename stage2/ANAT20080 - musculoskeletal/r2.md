## Glenohumeral joint
| Type | Articulating surfaces | Ligaments | Specialisations | Movement | Blood supply | Innervation | 
| ---- | --------------------- | --------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------ | ----------- | 
| ball and socket synovial | (anatomical) head of humerus with glenoid fossa of scapula | coracohumeral, transverse, glenohumeral (superior, middle, inferior) | subacromial bursa, subdeltoid bursa, subtendinous bursa; intertubercular synovial sheath; joint stability via tendon of SITS/rotator cuff muscles, tendon of long head of biceps brachii, coracoacromial arch; tendon of long head of biceps brachii restricts upwards movement; glenoid labrum: fibrocartilage rim around glenoid fossa, attached to edges, helps deepen cavity and reduce dislocation risk; articular capsule: from edge of glenoid fossa and labrum to anatomical neck of humerus | flexion and extension, abduction and adduction, lateral and medial rotation, circumduction, of humerus | circumflex humeral artery, branches of: axillary artery, suprascapular artery | small branches of: axillary, subscapular, musculocutaneous, pectoral, suprascapular, nerves |

## Humeroulnar and radiohumeral joint**
| Type | Articulating surfaces | Ligaments | Specialisations | Movement | Blood supply | Innervation | 
| ---- | --------------------- | --------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------ | ----------- | 
| hinge type synovial | humeroulnar: trochlea of humerus and trochlear notch of ulna, radiohumeral: head of radius and capitulum of humerus | radial collateral ligament; ulnar collateral ligament: anterior band, posterior band and oblique band; (joint to annular ligament) | joint capsule: from medial and lateral epicondyle, olecranon, coronoid and radial fossae, coronoid process; sacciform recess of synovial membrane for radioulnar joint; continuous with annular ligament of radioulnar joint; fat pads between synovial membrane and fibrous membrane at radial, coronoid and olecranon fossae; bursae: intratendinous (within tendon of triceps), subtendinous (between olecranon and triceps tendon), subcutaneous (between skin) | uniavial, flexion and extension | anastomotic network from collateral and recurrent branches of these arteries: brachial, profunda brachii (deep brachial), radial and ulnar | predominantly by: radial and musculocutaneous nerve; also by: ulnar and median nerve | 
** note that elbow joint as a whole, consists of humeroulnar, radiohumeral and proximal radioulnar joints
*** carrying angle: men 10-15, women 20-25 degrees
**** resting position: midway pronation and supination

## Proximal radioulnar joint
| Type | Articulating surfaces | Ligaments | Specialisations | Movement | Blood supply | Innervation | 
| ---- | --------------------- | --------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------ | ----------- | 
| pivot type synovial | head of radius, radial notch of ulna | osteoligamentous ring formed by annular ligament | fibrous capsule and synovial membrane a continuation of elbow joint: sacciform recess (from synovial membrane of elbow joint) and annular ligament | rotation (allows for pronation and supination) | anterior and posterior interosseous arteries | musculocutaneous, median, radial and ulnar nerve |

## Distal radioulnar joint**
| Type | Articulating surfaces | Ligaments | Specialisations | Movement | Blood supply | Innervation | 
| ---- | --------------------- | --------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------ | ----------- | 
| pivot type synovial | distal head of ulna, ulnar notch of radius | none | fibrous articular disc: from ulnar styloid to ulnar notch, separates distal radioulnar joint from wrist joint; fibrous capsule is attached to articular margins and articular disc inferiorly | allows pronation and supination; ulnar notch of radius slides anteriorly and medially over convex surface of head of ulna for pronation | anterior and posterior interosseous arteries | anterior and posterior interosseous nerves | 
** during supination and pronation, radius and ulna are held together by annular ligament, interosseous membrane and articular disc at distal radioulnar joint (includes wrist joint)

## Hand
### Wrist joint
| Type | Articulating surfaces | Ligaments | Specialisations | Movement | 
| ---- | --------------------- | --------- | --------------- | -------- | 
| ellipsoid/condyloid type synovial | distal end of radius; articular disc at distal end of ulna; scaphoid and lunate (carpal bones) | fibrous membrane; ulnar collateral ligament; radial collateral ligament | articular disc | flexion and extension, adduction and abduction of wrist | 

### Carpometacarpal
| Type | Articulating surfaces | Movement | 
| ---- | --------------------- | -------- | 
| thumb: saddle joint | distal row of carpal bones articulate with base of metacarpals | for metacarpals 2-5: limited gliding movements | 

### Intermetacarpal
| Articulating surfaces | 
| --------------------- | 
| metacarpals articulate with each other towards their proximal ends | 

### Metacarpophalangeal
| Type | Articulating surfaces | Ligaments | Movement |  
| ---- | --------------------- | --------- | -------- |  
| condyloid/ellipsoid type synovial | base of proximal phalanges of digits articulate with heads of metacarpals | joint capsule, palmar ligaments, medial and lateral collateral ligaments, deep transverse metacarpal ligaments (connect palmar ligaments together and restrict movement of bones relative to another) | flexion and extension, adduction and abduction, circumduction | 

### Interphalangeal
| Type | Articulating surfaces | Ligaments | Specialisations | Movement | 
| ---- | --------------------- | --------- | --------------- | -------- | 
| uniaial hinge joints | between base and head of phalanx bones | medial and lateral collateral ligaments, palmar ligaments | two sets: distal interphalangeal (DIP) and proximal interphalangeal joints (PIP) | uniaxial: flexion and extension | 

### Intercarpal
| Articulating surfaces | Specialisations | 
| --------------------- | --------------- | 
| between carpal bones: pisiform articulates with anterior surface of triquetrum, trapezium articulates with metacarpal I, capitate articulates with metacarpal III, proximal surface of scaphoid and lunate articulate with distal end of radius, distal row articulates with metacarpals | forms carpal tunnel along with flexor retinaculum; tendonsa and flexor digitorum superficialis profundus, and flexor pollicis longus pass through; median nerve passes through, compression can cause carpal tunnel syndrom leading to atrophy of hypothenar muscles |
