## The axilla
- is a named anatomical space
- pyramid-shaped area
    - lies inferior to glenohumeral joint
    - junction between arm and thorax
    - passageway for neurovascular (nerves and blood vessels) structures
- size and shape of axilla varies with abduction
    - decreases in size with arm fully abducted
    - axillary contents at most risk of injury when upper limb is abducted

### Axillary boundaries
- **anterior:** pectoralis major and minor, clavipectoral fascia, subclavius
- **posterior:** subscapularis, teres major, latissimus dorsi
- **medial:** serratus anterior, upper ribs, intercostal muscle and their associated intercostal spaces
- **lateral:** intertubercular (bicipital) groove of humerus
- **base:** axillary fascia and skin
- **apex:** (axillary inlet) superior border of scapula, 1st rib, clavicle

### Passageways through the axilla
- axilla acts as a junction between upper limb and thorax
- important neurovascular structures enter/exit via the acilla
- **clavipectoral triangle** in anterior axillary wall
    - bounded by pectoralis major, deltoid and clavicle
        - pectoral nerves and cephalic vein
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/8Y9F2O3.png =200x)
- **quadrangular space** in posterior axillary wall
    - bounded by teres major and minor, triceps, surgical neck of humerus
        - axillary nerve and posterior circumflex humeral arteries
        - quadrangular space syndrome

### Contents of the axilla
- **branches of the brachial plexus**
    - nerve supply to upper limb
- **axillary blood vessels**
    - axillary artery and branches
    - axillary vein and tributaries
- **axillary lymph vessels and nodes**
- **muscle tendons**
    - biceps brachii
    - coracobrachialis

## Arterial system of upper limb
- subclavian
- axillary
- brachial
- ulnar
- radial
- palmar arches
- dorsal and palmar digital arteries

### Arterial supply of upper limb
- the arterial supply to the upper limb begins in the chest as the **subclavian artery**
- to enter the axilla, the subclavian artieries cross the lateral border of the 1st rib and become **axillary arteries**

### Axillary artery
- the subclavian artery in the neck continues as the **axillary artery**
    - supplies wall so fhte axilla and related regions
- starst at lateral border of 1st rib
- passes through axilla
- ends at lateral border of teres major
    - becomes brachial artery

- **divided into 3 parts by pectoralis minor**
    - axillary artery passes posterior to pectoralis minor muscle
- 1st part:
    - proximal to pec. minor
    - lateral margin of 1st rib to upper border of pec. minor
- 2nd part:
    - posterior to pec. minor
- 3rd part:
    - distal to pec. minor
    - lower border of pec. minor to termination at teres major

- **axillary artery branches**
- 1 branch from 1st, 2 branches from 2nd, 3 branches from 3rd
- **s**end **t**he **l**ord **t**o **s**ay **a** **p**rayer: (from proximal to distal)
    - **s**uperior thoracic
    - **t**horacoacromial
    - **l**ateral **t**horacic
    - **a**nterior circumflex humeral
    - **p**osterior circumflex humeral

- **thoracoacromial artery branches ABCD:**
    - **a**cromial, **b**reast (pectoral), **c**lavicular, **d**eltoid

#### Branches of 1st part of axillary artery
- superior thoracic artery
    - quite small
    - originates from anterior surface of 1st part of the axillary artery
    - supplies both pectoral muscles, thoracic wall and breast
    - supplies upper regions of medial and anterior axillary walls
   
#### Branches of 2nd part of axillary artery
- thoracoacromial artery 
    - quite short 
    - originates from anterior surface of 2nd part of the axillary artery just posterior to medial margin of the pectoralis minor muscle
    - curves around the muscle, penetrates the clavipectoral fascia, divides into 4 branches **(ABCD)**
        - **a**cromial, **b**reast (pectoral), **c**lavicular, **d**eltoid
    - supplies pectoral, acromial, clavicular and deltoid regions
- lateral thoracic artery
    - originates from anterior surface of 2nd part of the axillary artery posterior to lateral margin of the pectoralis minor
    - follows the margin of the muscle to the thoracic wall to supply medial and anterior walls of the axilla
    - supplies pectoral and serratus anterior muscles, major supply for breast
    - in women, contributes to vascular supply of breast

#### Branches of 3rd part of axillary artery
- subscapular artery
    - divides into circumflex scapular artery and continues as thoracodorsal artery
    - largest branch of axillary artery and major blood supply to posterior wall of axilla
    - contributes to blood supply of posterior scapular region
    - follows the inferior margin of the subscapularis muscle and divides into 2 terminal branches:
        - circumflex scapular artery
        - thoracodorsal artery
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/UUlOezW.png =250x)
- anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries
    - supplies shoulder joint and shoulder muscles
    - anterior circumflex humeral artery:
        - passes anterior to the surgical neck of the humerus and anastomoses with the posterior circumflex humeral artery
        - supplies branches to glenohumeral joint and head of humerus
    - posterior circumflex humeral artery
        - leaves axilla with axillary nerve, passing through the quadrangular space (between teres major and minor, triceps brachii, and surgical neck of humerus)
        - curves around surgical neck of humerus
        - supplies surrounding muscles and glenohumeral joint

### Arterial supply of arm
- the axillary artery becomes the **brachial artery**
    - at the lateral border of teres major
    - main source of blood for arm

#### Axillary vein
- a continuation of **basilic vein**
- lies medial to axillary artery in axilla
- **cephalic vein** drains into axillary vein in axilla
- **axillary sheath** encloses cords of brachial plexus, axillary artery and vein

## Lymphatic system
- the lymphatic system drains tissue fluid, plasma proteins and cellular debris back into the blood stream
- role in immune defence
- lymph is filtered by lymph nodes and directed into the venous system
- lymphatic plexus = interconnected netwrk of lymph vessels that drain lymph in one-way flow

### Axillary lymph nodes
- filter lymph that has drained from upper limb and pectoral region
    - **pectoral (anterior)**
        - 3-5 nodes in the medial wall of the axilla
    - **subscapular (posterior)**
        - 6-7 nodes along the posterior axillary fold
    - **humeral (lateral)**
        - 4-6 nodes in the lateral wall of the axilla
    - **central**
        - 3-4 large nodes in fat as base of axilla
    - **apical**
        - in the apex of the axilla at lateral border of 1st rib

## Brachial plexus
- major nerve network (plexus) of upper limb
- functions in conducting signals from spine to shoulder, arm and hand
    - supplies motor and sensory innervation to upper limb and pectoral girdle
- begins in neck and extends into axilla posterior to clavicle

## Clinical conditions (related to axilla)
- thoracic outlet syndrome
    - neurovascular compression: blood vessels or brachial plexus against clavicle or first rib
        - trauma, sports injury, extra rib
        - neurological symptoms: pain in upper limb, tingling, numbness, muscle weakness
        - vascular symptoms: pallor in hand, cold hands/arm, weak pulse, blood clots

- lymphogenic spread of breast cancer
    - in breast cancer, the axillary lymph nodes may be biopsied or removed (axillary clearace) to prevent metastatic growth

- axillary intertrigo
    - rash in body folds with excessive perspiration, often bacteria
