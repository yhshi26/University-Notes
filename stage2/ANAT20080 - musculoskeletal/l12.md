## Joints
- site of articulation between bones
- synovial joints
    - permit extensive motion
    - contain synovial fluid
- characteristic features:
    - fibrous joint capsule
    - synovial membrane
    - cartilage covering articulating surfaces
        - articular hyaline cartilage
    - capsular ligaments

### Types of synovial joints
![](https://i.imgur.com/3mLx7pU.png =400x)

## Elbow joint
- uniaxial hinge type synovial joint
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/TunLgs5.png =150x)
- functions in shortening or lengthening upper limb
    - properly place hand in space
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/Q7YjENc.png =200x)
- 3 separate articulations:
    1. **humeroulnar:** trochlear notchof ulna and trochlea of humerus
    2. **radiohumeral:** head of radius and paitulum of humerus
    3. **proximal radioulnar:** head of radius and radial notch of ulna
- while the superior radioulnar joint shares the joint capsule with the elbow joint, it is considered a **separate articulation**

### Joint capsule
- surrounded by a fibrous capsule stretching from the articulating margins
    - medial epicondyle and margins of olecranon, coronoid and radial fossae of humerus
    - coronoid process and olecranon of ulna
    - does not insert onto radius but surrounding anular ligament
- capusle lined by synovial membrane

### Synovial membrane
- lines deep surface of joint capsule, medial surface of trochlea and fossae
- separated from fibrous membrane of joint capsule by fat pads overlying
    - radial fossa
    - coronoid fossa
    - olecranon fossa
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/9chqt2o.png =200x)
- a pocket of synovial membrane protrudes from inferior margin of joint capsule
    - sacciform reccess
    - facilitates rotation of radial head during pronation and supination
    
### Ligaments
- radial and ulnar collateral ligaments
    - medial and lateral thickenings of joint capsule
    - support flexion and extension movements of elbow joint
    - strengthen capsule
- anular ligament
    - cuffs head of radius
    - allows radial head to slide against radial notch of ulna and pivot on capitulum during pronation and supination
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/9KF4efO.png =200x)
    
#### Radial collateral ligament
- from below lateral epicondyle of humerus to annular ligament of radius
![](https://i.imgur.com/yHGCKBO.png =200x)

#### Ulnar collateral ligament
- from medial epicondyle to medial side of coronoid process and olecranon
- composed of 3 parts
    - anterior band
    - posterior band
    - oblique band

### Bursae of elbow joint
- a bursa (pl. bursae) is a membraneous sac filled with synovial fluid
- acts to cushion moving parts of joint
- many bursae in elbow
- clinically important as they can get irritated and inflamed, producing pain
    - bursitis

#### Important bursae of elbow
- **intratendinosus bursa:** formed within tendon of triceps brachii
- **subtendinosus bursa:** found between olecrannon of tendon of triceps brachii, reducing friction between the two structures during extension and flexion of arm
- **subcutaneous bursa:** found between skin over posterior aspect of joint and tendon of triceps

### Elbow joint innervation/vascularisation
- vascular supply through anatsomotic network of vessels
- arterial supply from collateral and recurrent branches of
    - brachial
    - profunda brachii
    - radial
    - ulnar
- innervated predominantly by branches of radial and musculocutaneous nerves
    - some contributions from ulnar and median nerves
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/RG7IH2J.png =200x)

### Carrying angle of elbow joint
- in anatomical position, arms are side by side, palms forward
- forearm and hands normally 5 to 15 degrees away from body (10-15 degrees in men, 20-25 degrees in women)
    - this is the normal "carrying angle" of the elbow joint
        - allows forearms to clear higs when arms swing in walking
        - carrying objects
- fractures of elbow joint can increase carrying angle, causing arms to stick out too much from body (called "excessive carrying angle")

### Movements
- flexion
- extension
- 3 Bs bend elbow joint
    - brachialis
    - biceps
    - brachioradialis
- extension
    - triceps brachii
    - anconeus
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/qlGHZ5I.png =250x)

## Proximal radioulnar joint
- head of radius articulates with radial notch of ulna
- pivot type of synovial joint
- allows rotation radius head on ulna within annular ligament
- hyaline cartilage on articulating surfaces of bones
- fibrous capsule and synovial membrane continuous with that of elbow joint
- anular ligament forms oste-ligamentous ring with radial notch of ulna
    - rotation radius head
- blood supply from anterior and posterior interosseous arteries
- innervation from musculocutaneous, median, radial and ulnar nerves

## Clinical conditions

### Epicondylitis
- lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow)
    - repetitive use of superficial extensor muscles of forearm
    - muscle most often affected by tennis elbow: **extensor carpi radialis brevis**
- medial epicondylitis (golfer's elbow)
    - oversuse strain of flexor muscles of forearm
    - pain typically around medial epicondyle and may resolve after rest
    - if pain/inflammation persist, surgical intervention may be necessary

### Fracture of olecranon
- common fracture due to protrusion of olecranon subcutaneously
- the typical mechanism of injury is fall on elbow combined with sudden powerful contraction of triceps brachii
- the fractured olecranon is pulled away by the triceps
    - often considered to be an avulsion fracture
- due to traction/pull of triceps on olecranon fragment, surgical intervention and pinning usually necessary

### Avulsion of medial epicondyle
- avulsion of medial epicondyle in children can result from a fall causing sever abduction of extended elbow
    - the epiphysis of medial epicondyle may not fuse with the distal end of humerus until us to age 20
- traction on the ulnar collateral ligament pulls medial epicondyle distally
- traction injury of the ulnar nerve is a frequent complication
    - ulnar nerve passes posterior to the medial epicondyle before entering forearm
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/VXdXvXG.png =250x)
    
### Supraepicondylar fracture
- often occurs by fall on flexed elbow
- transverse fracture between the two epicondyles
- the displayed fracture fragments or localised swelling may damage contents of cubital fossa
- can interrupt blood supply of forearm from brachial artery
- resulting ischaemia can cause **volkmann's ischaemic contracture**
    - uncontrolled flexion of hand as flexors muscles become short and fibrotic
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/kncn68m.png =350x)
- can damage medial or radial nerves

### Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction
- rupture or tearing of ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) common
    - e.g. baseball pitching
- recongstruction of UCL involves transplant of long tendon from contralateral forearm or leg (plamaris longus or plantaris tendon)
- tendon is passes through holes drilled through medial epicondyle of humerus and lateral aspect of coronoid process of ulna
![](https://i.imgur.com/7axBzd1.png =250x)

### Radial head subluxation "pulled elbow"
- typically occurs in children under 5
- commonly caused by sharp upwards pull on child's hand
    - the not-yet-developed radius head and laxity of anular ligament allow radial head to sublux (slip) from this cuff of tissue
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/p2ERoK3.png =400x)
- is extremely painful but can be treated easily: simply supinate and compress elbow joint
    - when radial head relocates, pain subsides immediately

### Bursitis of elbow joint
- subcutaneous olecranon bursa can be injured
    - due to falls on elbow
    - can be infected by skin abrasions of olecranon
- repeated excessive pressure and friction may cause this bursa to become inflamed
    - produces friction subcutaneous olecranon bursitis
        - student's elbow
        - dart thrower's elbow
        - miner's elbow
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/fuO83Kj.png =200x)
- occasionally, the bursa becomes infected and the area over the bursa becomes inflamed

### Fat pad sign
- FOOSH in adults: radial head fracture, difficult to visualise on radiographs
- posterior displacement of intra-articular, extrasynovial fat by fluid of the joint
- fat is normally visible within olecranon fossa on a 90 degree flexed lateral view of elbow
- frequently associated with intra-articular trauma but may be seen with arthritis or joint infection
![](https://i.imgur.com/QYnBd6U.png =250x)

## Cubital fossa
- seen superficially as a depression on anterior aspect of elbow
- deeply, it is a space filled with a variable amount of fat anterior to the most distal part of humerus and elbow joint
![](https://i.imgur.com/EYYhIio.png =250x)

### Cubital fossa boundaries
- **superiorly:** an imaginary line through medial and lateral epicondyles of humerus
- **laterally:** medial wall of brachioradialis
- **medially:** lateral wall of pronator teres
- **roof:** deep fascia including bicipital aponeurosis, subcutaneous tissue, skin
- **floor:** brachialis and supinator muscles
![](https://i.imgur.com/5z9aTPB.png =250x)

### Cubital fossa contents
- **m**y **b**ottoms **t**urned **r**ed
- from medial to lateral:
    - **m**edian nerve
    - **b**rachial artery
    - **t**endon of biceps
    - **r**adial nerve
- **r**eally **n**eed **b**ooze **t**o **b**e **a**t **m**y **n**icest
- from lateral to medial:
    - **r**adial **n**erve
    - **b**iceps **t**endon
    - **b**rachial **a**rtery
    - **m**edian **n**erve
