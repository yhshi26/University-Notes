## Brachial plexus

### Axillary nerve
- roots: C5, C6
- motor: teres minor, deltoid
- sensory: superior lateral cutaneous nerve of arm innervates inferior region of deltoid (regimental badge area)
![](https://i.imgur.com/LO7iodA.png =450x)
- exits axilla through quadrangular space
- passes around surgical neck of humerus providing motor innervation to deltoid
- gives small motor branch to teres minor
- provides cutaneous sensation to skin overlying deltoid (regimental badge area)

### Musculocutaneous nerve
- roots: C5-C7
- motor: BBC, biceps brachii, brachialis, coracobrachialis
- sensory: lateral cutaneous branch of forearm, innervates lateral 1/2 of anterior forearm and lateral portion of posterior forearam
![](https://i.imgur.com/xDOboav.png =450x)
- pierces through coracobrachialis
- descends between biceps and brachialis (giving motor innervation to both)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/aaqlwYk.png =250x)
- terminates as a cutaneous sensory branch (lateral cutaneous nerve of forearm) in lateral forearm

### Median nerve
- roots: C6-T1
- motor: forearm flexors, thenar muscles
- sensory: palmar cutaneous branch innervates lateral palm, digital cutaneous branch innervates lateral 3 1/2 fingers on palmar hand
![](https://i.imgur.com/WVWnVh4.png =450x)
- courses along anteromedial arm
- enters cubital fossa
- innervates superficial and intermediate muscles of anterior forearm
- branches into anterior interosseous to provide motor innervation to deep flexor muscles of anterior forearm
- continues distally, passing through carpal tunnel to supply thenar muscles and later 2 lumbricals
- provides cutaneous sensation to palm

### Ulnar nerve
- roots: C8, T1
- motor: muscles of hand (except thenar muscles and 2 lateral lumbricals), flexor carpi ulnaris and medial 1/2 flexor digitorum profundus
- sensory: innervates anterior and posterior surfaces of medial 1 1/2 digits and palm
![](https://i.imgur.com/e4m0n6d.png =450x)
- runs along anteromedial arm
- passes posterior to medial epicondyle at elbow (vulnerable to injury)
- passes flexor carpi ulnaris and travels alongside ulna
- supplies the 1/2 flexor digitorum profundus (medial half) and flexor carpi ulnaris in anterior forearm
![](https://i.imgur.com/IoJOIHb.png =250x)
- passes superficial to the flexor retinaculum at wrist through guyon's canal
- supplies intrinsic muscles of hand:
    - hypothenar muscles
    - medial 2 lumbricals
    - adductor pollicis
    - interossei
    - palmaris brevis
- cuntaneous branches supply skin of medial side of hand
    - dorsum and palm
    - (striped areas)

### Radial nerve
- roots: C5-T1
- motor: triceps brachii, forearm extensors
- sensory: innervates posterior aspect of arm and forearm, posterior and lateral aspects of hand
![](https://i.imgur.com/yKogMkN.png =450x)
- descends in spiral (radial) groove of humerus supplying triceps
- turns around lateral epicondyle through cubital fossa
- divides into superficial (sensory)
- deep (motor) branches: posterior interosseous nerve forearm extensor muscles
