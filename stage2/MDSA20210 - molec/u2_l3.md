## Carbohydrates (also called saccharides)
- most abundant biomolecules in nature
- major food source for energy generation
- major component of nuclic acids
- provide structural omponents
    - extracellular matrix
    - physiological lubricants e.g. synovial fluid
- cell's **glyco**calyx composed of
    - **glyco**proteins
    - **glyco**lipids

### Monosaccharides
- saccarides are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones
- \>=5C monosaccharides form cyclic structures around the anomeric carbon via a process called **mutarotation**

#### Mutarotation
- alpha and beta forms are **anomers** which can interconvert via linear form
- solution of D-glucose - 1/3 alpha, 2/3 beta, small amount linear form

#### Common monosaccharides
- fructose = ketose; differs in bonding structure 
- glucose, mannose, galactose = aldohexoses; differ in how consituent groups are arranged in space (stereoisomers); same physical and chemical properties but different biological properties and activities

##### Stereoisomers
![](https://i.imgur.com/54ala6u.png =125x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/f3NlNn0.png =100x)
- glyceraldehyde has 1 chiral (asymmetric) carbon, forms 2^1^ = 2 stereoisomers
    - stereoisomers of gylceraldehyde are mirror images = **enantiomers** = D and L forms
    - (note: by convention, D form = form with -OH on right of the chiral carbon furthest away from the anomeric carbon)
- glucose has 4 chiral carbons, forms 2^4^ = 16 stereoisomers
    - 8 mirror image pairs = D and L forms
    - D forms are most common in biological systems
    - diagram: some stereoisomers of glucose

### Monosaccharides combine by forming glycodisic bonds
- formed between anomeric carbon of one saccharide and a hydroxyl group on another molecule
    - condensation reaction (OH + H removed to form H~2~O and glycosidic linkage)
- formed in alpha or beta configuration

#### Common disaccharides
- alpha linkages form when both reacting groups are on the same side of the ring structures
![](https://i.imgur.com/CRKml35.png =200x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/p20kUAF.png =200x)
- beta linkages form when the reacting groups are on different sides of the ring structures
![](https://i.imgur.com/qSFHTsu.png =200x)

#### Reducing sugars
- where the anomeric C is free to mutarotate, it can act as a reducing agent
![](https://i.imgur.com/YpjxmkZ.png =200x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/IEKcPfv.png =200x)
- used in dip-stick tests to detect reducing sugars in urine
- all monosaccharides are reducing sugars

### Polysaccharides (also called glycans)
- most sugars are present in polysaccharides
- storage polysaccharides
    - homopolymers of glucose
        - starch in plants (rice, wheat, potatoes, etc.)
        - glycogen in animals
- structural polysaccharides
    - cellulose in plants: also a homopolymer of glucose
    - glycosaminoglycans in animals: polymers of repeating disaccharide units; major constituents of the extracellular matrix and physiological lubricants

#### Storage polysaccharides

##### Starch
- homopolymer of glucose
- 2 forms
    - amylose: linear polymer of glucose units linked in alpha 1-4 linkages
    - amylopectin: branched polymers pf amylose linked together via alpha 1-6 linkages
- storage polysaccharide in plants: stored and packed in granules
![](https://i.imgur.com/mMVuuZD.png =200x)

##### Glycogen
- homopolymer of glucose
- storage form of glucose in animals
- branched chains of alpha 1-4 linked glucose with alpha 1-6 linkages at branch points; more highly branched than amylopectin
- forms granules
- synthesised and broked down one unit at a time at the non-reducing ends
![](https://i.imgur.com/1fJ5rze.png =250x)
- highly branched structure enables rapid release or storage of glucose
- glycogen constitutes up to 10% of liver mass and 1-2% of muscle mass
    - liver glycogen = glucose reserve for maintenance of blood glucose levels
    - muscle glycogen = glucose reserve for muscle activity

##### Cellulose
- homopolymer of glucose
- glucose units are linked in beta 1-4 glycosidic bonds
- forms linear fibers: major component of wood
- indigestible: we don't have enzymes to brak it down
![](https://i.imgur.com/gm4YOIA.png =250x)

#### Structural polysaccharides
- **glycosaminoglycans** (also called mucopolysaccharides)
- major components of extracellular matrix
- are molecules that provide:
    - compressibility to cartilage
    - viscosity to synovial fluid (shock absorption) and vitreous humour (lubrication) in the eye
    - slimy texture in mucus: protection against dehydration and infection
![](https://i.imgur.com/quIm2K9.png =250x)

##### Glycosaminoglycans
- contain modified monosaccharides
- are long linear **heteropolymers**
    - >100 monosaccharides long in repeating disaccharide units
    - disaccharide unit usually comprises a **sulfated** amino sugar and an acidic sugar linked in **beta linkages**
- negative charge and beta linkage = an extended linear structure
![](https://i.imgur.com/UiMRmNN.png =250x)
- diagram: monosaccharides found in GAGs
![](https://i.imgur.com/n7tLRKZ.png =250x)
- most GAGs are covalently linked to a core protein, forming **proteoglycans**
- "bottle-brush" structure
    - absorbs large quantities of water
- ensures that GAGs
    - are viscous in solution
    - forms gel at high concentrations
- examples = chondroitin sulphate, keratin sulphate...
![](https://i.imgur.com/F3ApKK3.png =250x)

##### Hyaluronic acid
- forms very long polymers of up to 10 micro meters, more than 10,000 repeating units; not covalently linked to protein; not sulphated
- associates with other GAGs to form large aggregates
- highly hydrated; forms viscous solutions at low ceoncentrations and gels at high concentrations
- lubricant; major component of synovial fluid, vitreous humor of they eye
![](https://i.imgur.com/Y4J9Qhf.png =200x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/Dh9n4i6.png =200x)

##### Heparin
- **not** a structural GAG
- disaccharide sugars are in alpha linkage, so heparin does not have an extended structure
- packed into granules in mast cells and released at sites of injury
- acts as an anti-coagulant, preventing fibrin formation
![](https://i.imgur.com/9i2GRpD.png =200x)

##### Glycoproteins
- protein covalently linked to an oligosaccharide
- oligosaccharide
    - usually short, 2-10 residues
    - branched
    - terminal sugar often = sialic acid
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/QUxJ4yb.png =200x)

### Complex carbohydrates

#### Glycoproteins
- differ from proteoglycans: ratio of protein to carbohydrate much higher
- carbohydrate chains
    - short, branched
    - do not contain repeating disaccharide units
- linked to protein via:
    - O- linkage to serine, threonine or hydroxylysine (in collagen)
    - N- inkage to asparagine
- most glycoproteins have both O- and N-linked oligosaccharides attached
![](https://i.imgur.com/9x4pD3z.png =200x)
- over 50% of all proteins are glycoproteins
- cell-membrane associated glycoproteins important for membrane structure, cell-cell communication, immune recognition...
- all secreted proteins are glycoproteins (e.g. plasma proteins)
- glycosylated in ER and golgi and then delivered to cell surface/secreted via endocytosis
