> learning objectives: how lipids are digested in animals, how lipids are transported between tissues (lipoproteins, triglycerides, cholesterol), how lipids are destroyed

## Lipid digestion and transport
- digestion and transport of lipids poses unique problems relating to the **insolubility of lipids in water**
- enzymes that act on lipids are soluble proteins or membrane proteins at the aqueous interface
- lipids and products of their digestion must be transported through aqueous compartments within the cell as well as in the blood and tissue spaces

### Dietary lipids
- average daily consumption ~80g fat
    - â‰¥ 30% caloric intake (recommended ~20%)
- TGs comprise approx. 90% our dietary lipid consumption
    - remainder is cholesterol and cholesterol esters, phospholipids and non-esterified (free) fatty acids
- digestion occurs mainly in duodenum with absorption occuring in small intesting
    - lipases (TGs)
    - cholesterol esterases (cholesterol esters)
    - phospholipases (phospholipids)

### Enzymatic digestion of TGs in GIT

### Bile acids and bile salts
- amphipathic lipids wihch act as biological detergents
- synthesised in liver from cholesterol and stored in gall bladder
    - secreted via bile duct into duodenum
    - bile salts more soluble and less cytotoxic than bile acids
- solubilise dietary lipids, aiding digestion
- 90-95% reabsorbed in ileum, 5-10% excreted

#### Bile acids and salts emulsify dietary lipids facilitating aciton of pancreatic lipase
- disperses large lipid droplets into smaller ones (emulsification)
    - increases surface area for pancreatic lipases to work on
- pancreatic lipase requires a second protein (colipase) for activity

## Lipid micelles and lipases
### Clinical correlation: pancreatic lipase inhibitors (orlistat/xenical)
- pancreatic lipase inhibitor reduces lipid absorption
- modest weight loss
    - 5-10% weight loss over 1 year
- increased lipid retention in gut can have unpleasant side effects
    - steatorrhea (loose, oily stools) and flatulence
    - recommended that meal fat content should not exceed 15g to minimise side effects
    - need to take vitamin supplements to prevent deficiency of fat soluble vitamins

### Formation of mixed micelles
- reaction products (free FAs, monoacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, cholesterol, phospholipids and other lipids) form mixed micelles with bile salts

### Lipid absorption and processing in enterocytes

#### Using plant sterols to block cholesterol absorption
- consumption of plant sterols and stanols can reduce cholesterol absorption in the gut
    - competitive inhibition
- 2-3g per day can effectively lower LDL cholesterol by 10% (0.3-0.6mmol/l)
    - reduce CHD risk by 25%
- can be taken as food additive, supplement or consumption of phytosterol rich whole foods e.g. wheat germ, vegetable oils, avocado, etc.

### Summary of TG breakdown and absoprtion in GIT
- TG too hydrophobic to be digested and absorbed
- must be 'solublised' by bile stalts and broken down to MAG/DAG and FAs
- MAG, DAG, and FAs can be absorbed
- TGs are then 'resynthesised' into enterocytes, packaged into lipoprotein particles and transported to liver and other tissues

## Lipid transport and lipoproteins
- lipids such as TGs and cholesterol are insoluble in plasma and therefore are tranpostred in special complexes termed lipoproteins
- consist of a core of hydrophobic lipids surrounded by a 'skin' of amphipathic lipids and proteins termed apolipoproteins
- these complexes differ in size, lipid content, apolipoprotein content, density (ratio of lipid to protein) and function
    - chylomicrons form in intestines
    - HDL, VLDL assembled in ER of liver cells
    - LDL not made directly, but evolves from VLDL
- free FAs (NEFAs) transported as complexes with serum albumin a low affinity non-specific lipid binding protein

### General structure of lipoprotein particle

### Apolipoproteins of plasma lipoproteins
![](https://i.imgur.com/0SWsClI.png =450x)

### Chylomicrons
- synthesised in ER of enterocytes
- released into lymphatic system before entering circulation
    - detected in circulation 1-2 hours after meal
- nascent CMs contain apoB48 but acquire apoA, C and E from HDL
- comprised mainly of TG (80-90%)
- **major function to trnaposrt dietary TAGs from gut to tissues:**
    - **liver, skeletal and cardiac muscle and adipose tissue**
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/OHes7s1.png =200x)

#### Blood plasma after meal
- turbitidy (milky appearance) due to presence of large numbers of chylomicrons which transport lipids absorbed in gut to liver and other tissues

#### Hydrolysis of CM TGs by lipoprotein lipase
- CM TGs are hydrolysed by enzyme **lipoprotein lipase (LPL)**
    - found on luminal surface of endothelial cells
        - **adipose tissue**
        - **skeletal and cardiac muscle**
        - **lactating mammary glands**
    - apoc-II required for activation of LPL
        - **adipose tissue: storage**
        - **skeletal/cardiac muscle: oxidised**
        - **liver takes up glycerol and MAG**
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/FPAIHgb.png =250x)
- LPL hormonally regulated
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZXYJTM3.png =350x)

#### Processing of chylomicron remnants
- TG hydrolysis reduces size and density of particles: chylomicron remnants
    - apolipoproteins
    - variable amounts of TAGs, PL, CE, MAG
- taken up by liver by receptor mediated endocytosis
    - LDL receptor
    - apoE dependent
- FAs may be re-esterified with glycerol to make TGs which may be sent to adipose tissue for storage or to peripheral tissues to be utilised... **VLDL**

#### Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL)
- **transport mainly TGs from liver to adipose tissue (storage) or peripheral tissues (utilisation)**
- nascent VLDLs contain apoB100 but acquire others (apoA, C and E) from HDL
- VLDL TGs hydrolysed by LPL (as described for CMs) forming VLDL remnants (IDL)
- ~50% VLDL remnants recycled in liver (as described for CM): requires apoE 
    - remainder converted to **LDL**
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/V5unLMC.png =200x)

#### Low density lipoproteins (LDL)
- LDL formed from IDL after...
    - CL/CE content of IDL enriched (and TG depleted) by exchange with HDL of TG for CL/CE
    - some apo's (except B100) transferred to HDL
- **LDL is major cholesterol carrier to peripheral tissues**
- ~40% LDLs transported to tissues which require CL for biosynthesis (e.g. steroid hormones)
- ~60% LDLs taken up by liver by receptor mediated endocytosis and recycled
![](https://i.imgur.com/Mm567TD.png =200x)

#### High density lipoproteins (HDL)
- heterogeneous collection of particles of slightly varying size/density (HDL 1-4)
- **major function is to transport cholesterol from tissues to liver for disposal**
    - **'reverse cholesterol transport'**
- contain multiple apolipoproteins (A, C, E)
    - also acts as source of these apolipoproteins in maturation of other lipoproteins
- HDLs associated with as many as 15 different proteins other than apolipoproteins
    - LCAT (lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase)
    - PTLP (phospholipid transfer protein)

## Cholesterol storage
- stored in lipid droplets in cytoplasm
    - converted to cholesterol esters (LCAT)
- most abundant in steroidogenic tissue
    - adrenal glands and gonads
    - in cholesterol excess, cholesterol rich lipid droplets maybe found in other tissues

### Cholesterol metabolism in liver

### Familial hypercholesterolemia
- autosomal dominant disorders
    - mutations of LDL receptor or apob100 genes
    - hepatic uptake of LDL absent or impaired
    - grossly elevated plasma cholesterol
- heterozygotes (1:500)
    - LDL > 200mg/dl, accelerated CAD, MI by age 30-40
    - atheromas at multiple sites
    - cutaneous and articular xanthomas
- management
    - diet and lifestyle changes
    - statins combined with bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe or niacin
    - LDL apheresis (selective removal of LDL)

### Clinical correlation: LDLs and atherogenesis
- excess LDLs can accumulate in intima of blood vessels
    - oxidised LDL antigenic/pro-inflammatory
    - macrophage infiltration of intima
- macrophages take up oxLDL by a 'scavenger receptor' mechanism (foam cells)
    - 'fatty streak'
- chronic inflammatory state in vessel wall
    - increases recruitment of inflammatory cells
    - VSMC and fibroblast proliferation
    - endothelial cell dysfunciton
- plaque formation
    - rupture
    - thrombus formation

### TGs are stored in dedicated energy depots in adipocytes
- highly reduced (energy dense) form of carbon
- no solvation/anhydrous (more compact than CHO)
    - sixfold greater mass of **glycogen** required to store same amount of energy as **fat**
    - if main fuel reservoir was stored as glycogen instead of fat, average body weight would be 60 lbs heavier
