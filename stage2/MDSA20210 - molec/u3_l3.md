## Fatty acid synthesis
- universal pathway (from microbes to man)
- in eukaryotic species, occurs in **cytosol**
- requires substrates and cofactors from other pathways and organelles
- **energy storage in times of excess**
- liver and mammary gland are major cites of FA synthesis and adipose tissue is main site of storage (TAGs)
- occurs when energy/substrates are abundant

### Summary of FA synthesis pathway
- acetyl coA (2C) converted to malonyl coA (3C) which serves as a donor of activated 2C acetyl units
- fatty acid chains are elongated by the sequential addition of 2C units from malonyl-coA in a series of 4 reactions
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/8Di5IHy.png =350x)
- elongation reactions are repeated until the FA chain reachse 16C in length (palmitic acid)
- elongation and/or desaturation requires additional enzymes and reactions

#### Transport of acetyl coA to cytosol: the citrate shuttle
- **problem: how to get acetyl coA from mitochondiral matrix to cytoplasm for FA synthesis; solution: citrate shuttle**
- most acetyl coA formed in mitochondrial matrix by pyruvate dehydrogenase (prelude to TCA cycle) and beta oxidation of FA
- must be transported to cytosol: citrate shuttle
- generate NADPH for FA synthesis (1 NADPH/acetyl coA transported) but costs 1 ATP
![](https://i.imgur.com/yhrHxwd.png =250x)

#### Formation of malonyl coA by acetyl coA carboxylase
- cytosolic enzyme that catalyses **carboxylation of actyl coA**
- requires **biotin** as cofactor
![](https://i.imgur.com/eEA9G37.png =350x)
- committed (irreversible) step: ATP hydrolysis
- major control point in fatty acid synthesis

#### Acyl carrier protein: carrier of intermediates in fatty acid synthesis
- **reaction intermediates of FA synthesis are attached to ACP via -SH group of phosphopantetheine (vit B~5~)**
    - catalysed by acetyltransferase enzyme that is part of the FA synthase (FAS) complex
    - attached to FAS
- long flexible side chain of ACP tranfers intermediates from one active site of FA synthase to the next
    - in terms of function **it's a large coA**

### Fatty acid synthase (FAS): a multienzyme complex
- multifunctional enzyme
- 5 distinct enzyme activities
    - beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KS)
    - malonyl/acetyl-coA-ACP transferase (MAT)
    - beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (DH)
    - enoyl-ACP reductase (ER)
    - beta-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (KR)
    - **production line**
- binds a separate peptide (acyl carrier protein) to which the reaction intermediates are attached
![](https://i.imgur.com/A2UduCC.png =200x)

### Cycle of 4 reactions extends FA chain by 2C from acetyl coA
![](https://i.imgur.com/YJ7FKnj.png =350x)

### Addition of acetyl and malonyl groups to fatty acid synthase/ACP
- tranfer of acetyl group from coA to beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase
    - catalysed by MAT
- attachment of malonyl group from malonyl coA to ACP
    - catalysed by MAT
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/70PgzVU.png =350x)

#### Reaction 1: condensation of acetyl and malonyl groups
- condensation of 2C acetyl unit and 3C malonyl unit with loss of CO~2~ to form C4 ketobutyryl intermediate
    - catalysed by KS
- condensation of 3C and 2C with loss of CO~2~ more energetically favourable than condensation of 2 x 2C acetyl units
![](https://i.imgur.com/tk643H3.png =250x)

#### Elongation of FA chain
- butyryl-ACP condenses with malonyl-ACP to make C6 beta-ketoacyl-ACP and CO~2~
- 5 more cycles generates C16 palmitoyl ACP
- palmitate is released after cleavage from ACP by thioesterase
- palmitate (C16) is the major end product of FAS
![](https://i.imgur.com/Udn534l.png =200x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/3E3a10P.png =450x)

### Overall reaction and bioenergetics of synthesis of C16:0 FA
- 8 NADPH from citrate shuttle (costs 1 ATP eahc) + 6 from PPP (costs 3 ATP) + 7 ATP from malonyl coA formation = 18ATP
- complete oxidation of palmitate yields > **100 ATP**
![](https://i.imgur.com/GzEnC8p.png =350x)

## Synthesis of other FAs from palmitate
- **elongation** by 2C increments
    - mitochondira and endoplasmic reticulum
    - similar series of reactions as described for FA synthase but catylsed by different enzymes
- **desaturation**
    - endoplasmic reticulum
    - desaturation beyond C9 only occurs in plants

### Comparison of FA oxidation and synthesis
![](https://i.imgur.com/ulhpWAn.png =350x)

### Regulation of FA synthesis: acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACC)
- ACC catalyses the irreversible, committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis
- key control point in FA **synthesis and oxidation**
    - malonyl coA inhibits beta oxidation by blocking FA entry into mitochondira (carnitine acyltranferase)
- ACC activity subject to allosteric regulation and reversible covalent modificaiton (phosphorylation)
- monomeric ACC inactive but can be converted to polymeric filamentous structure which is active

#### Allosteric regulation of ACC
- **pakmitoyl-coA** (product of FA synthase) inhibits ACC 
    - negative feedback inhibition
- **citrate** activates ACC
    - high levels of citrate signal energy abundance and favours storage of excess energy as FA
- regulatory effects of citrate and palmitoyl-coA are dependent on the phosphorylation state ACC
![](https://i.imgur.com/5YpnjXE.png =125x)

##### ACC phosphorylation alters enzyme sensitivity to allosteric regulators
- **phosphorylation of ACC inactivates it and dephosphorylation activates it**
    - protein kinases phosphorylate
    - protein phosphatases dephosphorylate
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/kR82eqc.png =350x)
- dephosphorylation lower K~m~ for citrate (increases sensitivity to citrate) and increases K~i~ for palmitoyl coA (reduces sensitivity to palmitoyl coA)
- phosphorylation reverses these effects

#### Hormonal regulation of ACC
- **hormones regulate ACC by controlling activity of protein kinases and phosphatases**
- glucagon activates protein kinases which phosphorylate (inhibit) ACC
    - **glucagon signals energy is low and lipid metabolism should switch from FA synthesis to oxidation**
- insulin activates protein phosphatases which dephosphorylate (activate ACC)
    - **insulin signals energy is abundant and lipid metabolism should switch from FA oxidation to synthesis**
- **FA synthesis and oxidation co-ordinately regulated**
![](https://i.imgur.com/vhQqbAP.png =350x)

### Regulation of lipid metabolism by FAs
- FAs can regulate expression of genes important in lipid metabolism
    - ligands for a nuclear receptor PPAR: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (alpha, beta, delta, lambda)
    - PPARs play essential roles in the regulation of cell differentiation, inflammation and metabolism
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/fWEHki0.png =300x)
- endogenous PPAR ligands are mostly PUFAs or eicosanoids
- form heterodimers with LXR receptor and bind to response elements in promoters of many genes
- lower FA, TG and cholesterol levels, enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation
- PPAR-alpha and lambda are targets of several drugs

#### Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): PPAR-lambda agonists
- not without side effects
    - hepatotoxicity (regular liver function tests)
    - weight gain of 1-4kg within 6-12 months
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/Xhki4aN.png =450x)

#### Clinical correlation: inhibitors of FA synthesis
- triclosan: enoyl ACP reductase (FAS) inhibitor broad-spectrum antibacterial agent used in a variety of products such as toothpaste, soaps and skin creams
![](https://i.imgur.com/xstOHJa.png =450x)

#### Reduction of adiposity by treatment of obese mice with FAS inhibitor (C75)
- obese (ob) mice received injections of C75 or saline once every 3d for 4wk
- food intake and body weight reduced by 62 and 43% respectively
- decreased food intake correlated with downregulation of orexigenic pathways (NPY/AgRP) and an upregulation of anorexigenic pathways (POMC/CART) in the hypothalamus

#### Acetyl coA carboxylase as a therapeutic target in obesity
- may also find applications as novel antibiotics and anticancer drugs
![](https://i.imgur.com/dQOm2wb.png =350x)

## Triglyceride synthesis
- occurs when FAs are abundant (signals surplus of energy/nutrients)
    - main sites of TG synthesis are liver, adipose tissue and intestine
    - in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum/peroxisome
- synthesis in:
    - **intestine** for reconstitution of dietary TGs that have been broken down and absorbed as mono-diacylglycerols
    - **adipose tissue** for storage purposes
    - **liver** for distribution to other tissues
- glycerol derived from glycolysis intermediate, FAs are either from dietary sources or from de novo synthesis

### 4 steps of tiacylglycerol synthesis
1. glycerol 3 phosphate synthesis
    - glycerol kinase found only in liver
2. sequential addition 2 FAs (coA derivative)
3. dephosphorylation
4. addition of 3rd FA
