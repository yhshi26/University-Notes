## Metabolism
> metabolism = all processes by which a cell maintains life
- converts food ↔ energy molecules
    - used for life-sustaining processes
        - organization
        - growth
        - replication
        - maintenance
        - repair

### Energy
- central to maintaining life
- need to extract energy from food and transfer it to an energy source useable by cells
#### Catabolism = metabolic processes that produce energy for cell (breakdown of macromolecules, releasing ATP)
#### Anabolism = metabolic processes that use energy (synthesizing macromolecules, using ATP)

### Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
- adenine bonded to ribose = adenosine, bonded to 3 phosphates (triphosphate)
    - the 3 phosphate bonds have high energy, can be broken/formed 
    - ATP ↔ ADP + phosphate ↔ AMP + phosphate 
### ATP ↔ ADP cycle
- a fundamental method of energy exchange in cells
- the ATP/ADP ratio of a cell is a critical measure of how much energy it has
- a single organism only has so much ATP in it (70g)
    - cells have constant, rapid turnover and regeneration of ATP (the same ones being used and reused)

### Electrons
- catabolism (breakdown of macromolecules to produce ATP) involves **oxidation** (oxygen causing loss of e- from macromolecules)
    - e- released by catabolism are transported by **transient electron carriers** elsewhere to either:
        - be used to regenerate ATP or
        - be used in energy-requiring (endergonic) anabolic reactions
- anabolism (production of macromolecules using ATP) involves **reduction** (uses e- released by catabolism to aid in macromolecule production)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/B3ySzIG.png =350x)

### Transient electron carriers
#### NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)
- NAD and NADPH
    - NAD = electron acceptor in catabolic pathways
    - NADPH = electron donor in anabolic pathways
- derived from niacin = vit B~3~
- bind reversibly to active sites of relevant enzymes
#### FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide)
- FAD = electron acceptor in catabolic pathways
- derived from riboflavin = vit B~2~
- covalently bound at active site of relevant enzymes = flavoproteins
#### NAD(P) and FAD/FMN
- act as enzyme cofactors or coenzymes
- enzyme won't work without them
- present in small amounts in cells
- reduced form needs to recycle to oxidised form rapidly - otherwise metabolic pathways that need the oxidised form stop (not good)

### Metabolism: common components
> general (both catabolic and anabolic): all pathways must be thermodynamically favourable (change in free energy must be negative - i.e. go from high energy state to lower energy state over pathway)

| Catabolic pathways | Anabolic pathways |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| breakdown energy-rich fuels | synthesise energy-rich macromolecules | 
| exergonic | endergonic |
| energy released transferred to ATP | energy required obtained from ATP |
| oxidation | reduction |
| electron carriers = NAD; FAD/FMN | electron carrier = NADPH |

#### Metabolic pathway example

A: much more robust system for getting energy out of food

### Reactions (reminders)
![](https://i.imgur.com/Zz0htC5.png =100x)
- K~eq~ = equilibrium constant of a reaction
    - K~eq~ > 1 when equilibrium favours products
    - K~eq~ < 1 when equilibrium favours reactants
- difference in available energy between reactants and products of reaction = change in free energy of reaction = ΔG
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/E4DcdMb.png =150x)
- reactions that release energy = exergonic, spontaneous, favour products, K~eq~ > 1, ΔG is neg (-)
- reactions that require input of energy = endergonic, K~eq~ < 1, ΔG is pos (+)

### Coupling reactions
- exergonic and endergonic reactions can be coupled as metabolic pathways
    - overall ΔG of metabolic pathway = Σ ΔG of individual reactions
    - e.g. coupled reaction: overall ΔG (-)

## Common metabolic reactions
| Type of reaction | Enzyme group | 
| ---------------- | ------------ | 
| transfer of electrons to coenzyme | dehydrogenases | 
| transfer of phosphate from ATP | kinases |
| C-C bond cleavage with addition of H~2~O | hydrolases |
| C-C bond formation coupled to ATP hydrolysis to ADP | synthetases (ligases) |
| rearrangement from one isomeric form to another | isomerases |
| transfer of a functional group | transferases (glycosyl; peptidyl) |

## All pathways are regulated
- at least one reaction in every pathway is essentially irreversible (high neg ΔG) = rate-limiting or "committing" step
- enzyme that catalyses the committing step is unique to that pathway
    - the pathway is reguglated by regulating the activity of this enzyme
    - rate-limiting enzymes are often targets for therapeutic drugs
        - statings inhibit the first committed step in cholesterol synthesis

### Regulation mechanisms
- allosteric control: molecules bind to allosteric site(s) on enzyme and increase/decrease its activity 
    - (second-by-second regulation in response to needs of cell)
    - feedback inhibition: products of the pathway inhibit activity of the enzyme
    - substrate/product activation: pathway substrate or product increases enzyme activity
- phosphorylation: enzyme turned "on"/"off" in response to metabolic needs of cell 
    - (rapid reulgation in response to needs of body)
- transcription control: amount of enzyme produced increased/decreased 
    - (slow(er) and more sustained regulation in response to needs of cell or body)

### Separating catabolic and anabolic pathways
- need to avoid "futile cycles" (as to not waste energy)
- pathway regulation via unique enzyme - can turn a specific pathway "on"/"off" in response to the metabolic needs of the cell
- separate pool of redox reagents for catabolic and anabolic pathways - NAD/NADP
- physical separation of pathways in cellular compartments
    - protein synthesis: endoplasmic reticulum
    - energy generation: mitochondria
    - degradation of extracellular debris and cellular macromolecules (turnover): lysosomes
    - transport of proteins from endoplasmic reticulum to cell surface and other intracellular organelles: golgi apparatus

## When things go wrong
- hundreds of congenital enzyme deficiencies that disrupt metabolic pathways (inborn errors of metabolism) 
    - enzyme deficiencies
        - phenylketonuria (PKU): deficiency of enzyme required for breakdown of amino acid phenylalanine
        - storage diseases: deficiency of enzymes required for breakdown of macromolecules
            - lysosomal storage diseases, defects in brakdown of glycoproteins and glycolipids
            - glycogen storage diseases, deficiencies in glycogen-degrading enzymes 
    - vitamin deficiencies
        - insufficient niacin (vit B~3~) or riboflavin (vit B~2~) in diet
        - disrupt a whole range of metabolic pathways

## Recap
- catabolic pathways
    - breakdown of energy-rich fuels to produce ATP
    - oxidation reactions: energy transfer via electron carriers NADH/FADH~2~ to ATP
- anabolic pathways
    - synthesis of macromolecules
    - energy input from ATP
    - reduction reactions: electron transfer from NADPH
- pathways made possible by enzyme catalysis and coupling of endergonic to exergonic reactions
- regulation and compartmentalisation ensure metabolic needs of cells are met
