> learning objectives: characteristic properties of lipids, main functions of lipids, different classes of lipids of biological importance and their structural features

## Major lipid properties and classes
- properties:
    - a heterogeneous class of naturally occuring organic compounds classified on the basis of common solubility properties
        - non-polar/hydrophobic = soluble in organic solvents but **not** water
        - largely hydrocarbon in nature
    - **can be amphipathic (mainly non-polar/hydrophobic but with some hydrophilic/polar groups**
- classes:
    - fatty acids (and their derivatives)
    - triacylglycerols (triglycerides)
    - (glycero)phospholipids
    - sphingolipids
    - cholesterol

### Functions of lipids
- the lipids of physiological importance for humans have 5 major functions:
    1. serve as structural components of biological membranes
    2. provide energy reserves, predominantly in the form of triacylglycerols
    3. both lipid and lipid derivatives serve as vitamins and hormones
        - fat soluble vitamins
        - eicosanoids (e.g. prsotaglandings)
        - steroid hormones
    4. bile acids aid in lipid solubilisation
    5. biological signalling molecules

## Fatty acids
- composed of long hydrocarbon chains (C10-24) with a terminal carboxylate (COO^-^) group
    - most naturally occurring FA have even no. C atoms
    - most are unbranched
- may be **saturated** (all C-C bond are single) or **unsaturated** (one more more C-C double bonds)
    - 1C-C double bond = **monounsaturated (MUFA)**
    - 2 or more C-C double bonds = **polyunsaturated (PUFA)**
- C-C double bonds in naturally occurring FA are cis (not trans)

- some FA are essential and must be consumed in our diet

### General structure
- position of C-C double bond may be denoted in relation to the C number (with 1 being the C atom of the -COO^-^ group)
- alternatively the position of C-C double bond may be denoted in relation to wC atom: e.g. w3, w6, w9, etc.
- most naturally occuring double bonds are cis (trans isomer rare) industrial production of MUFAs and PUFAs (hydrogenated fats) yield trans isomer and appears to increase risk of heart disease

#### Saturated fatty acids
- **saturated FAs have no C=C double bonds**
![](https://i.imgur.com/gXktQom.png =350x)

#### Unsaturated fatty acids
- **unsaturated FAs have 1 or more C=C double bonds**
![](https://i.imgur.com/Du5bJay.png =350x)
- **cis and trans C=C double bonds:**
    - some trans FAs naturally occur
    - dietary trans FAs produced by chemical/industrial processes
    - makes fats more solid or 'spreadable', helps to prolong self-life of food and maintain flavour stability
    - consumption of trans fats increases risk of coronary heart disease in part by raising LDL cholesterol

### Effect of FA (de)saturation on structure of lipid aggregates
- saturated FA chains pack tightly and form rigid, organized aggregates
- cis unsaturated chains bend and pack in less organized ways, with greater potential for motion i.e. more fluid 
- trans unsaturated chains are straighter

### Essential fatty acids
- PUFAs with ≥ 2 C=C double bonds, 1 of which is beyond C9
- as human and animal species cannot introduce double bonds into Fas after C9, some Fas are essential and must be consumed:
    - linolenic acid (C18:3): w3 fatty acid
    - linoleic acid (C18:2): w6 fatty acid
- coverted by elongation and desaturation to PUFAs with essential biological roles
    - linoleic acid → arachidonic acid (C20:4): ARA
    - linolenic acid → eicosapentaeonic acid (C20:5): EPA
- ARA and EPA serve as precursors for synthesis of eicosanoids 

### Fatty acid derivatives: eicosanoids
- derived from C20 **conditionally essential** PUFAs
    - C20:3 eicosatrienoic acid (ESA)
    - **C20:4 arachadonic acid (ARA)**
        - can be synthesized from essential FAs linoleic acid (C18:2) and linolenic acid (C18:3)
    - C20:5 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
- synthesis pathways
    - cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway (prostaglandins and thromoxane)
    - lipooxygenase (LOX) pathway (leukotriene)
- exert their actions by binding to specific plasma membrane receptors
- PGs and LTs function as local signalling molecules and play important roles in:
    - **inflammation (COX2 inhibitors are widely prescribed NSAIDs e.g. aspirin)**
    - regulation of vascular tone
    - and many more...

## Triacylglycerols (triglycerides)
- 3C alcohol (glycerol) esterified to 3 FA through -COOH group
![](https://i.imgur.com/9Q6Cpa5.png =200x)
- a major energy storage form in animals
    - stored in adipose tissue
    - highly reduced (energy dense) form of carbon
        - 1g of triacylglycerols yields about 38kJ of energy (twice as much as CHO or protein)
    - no solvation (take up less spce than highly hydrated CHO)
- other advantages:
    - insulation

### Triglyceride structure
- lipases cleave ester bonds and release the FAs
- FAs may all be the same or different and may be saturated, unsaturated or both

## (Glycero)phospholipids (GPLs)
- simplest GPL (parent compound) is phosphatidate
    - glycerol 3 phosphate esterified with 2 FA **(diacylglycerol)** with a PO~4~ at 3rd -OH group
    - if GPL contains an unsaturated FA, it will be at C2
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/wISsLEG.png =250x)
- a variety of polar alcohol compounds can be esterified to the PO~4~ group of phosphatidate, including:
    - choline (phosphatidylcholine or lecithin)
    - serine (phosphatidylserine)
    - ethanolamine (phosphatidylethanolamine)
    - inositol (phosphatidylinositol)
    - glycerol (phosphatidylglycerol)

### Structures of common GPLs

### Phospholipases break down GPLs

#### Snake venom phospholipases
- indian cobras kill several thousand people annualy
- the venoms of poinsonous snakes contain large amounts of phospholipase A2
- **lysolecithin,** a breakdown product of this reaction, acts as a biological detergent and dissolves the membranes of rbcs, causing them to rupture

### GPL properties
- **GPLs are amphipathic molecules:**
    - polar PO~4~ and alcohol groups
    - non-polar hydrophobic FA chains
    - amphipathic properties integral to role of GPL in biological membranes
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/MmQnFzk.png =350x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/qo0EHdE.png =350x)
- **unsaturated fatty acids change the fluidity and permeability of membranes:**
    - as T increases, fluidity and vv increases
    - as cholesterol increases, fluidity near memrbane surface decreases
        - cholesterol also acts as a 'spacer' allowing greater fluidity deeper inside the lipid bilayer
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/gIK24oL.png =350x)

## Glycolipids
- main class of glycolipids contain sphingosine and one or more sugars (glycosphingolipids: GSLs)
    - simples GSL is ceramide
- GSLs particularly abundant in nerve cell membranes
    - nerve impulse transmission
    - cell-cell recognition
    - moleculear recognition (biding glycoprotein hormones and bacterial toxins)
- genetic defects in GSL metabolism responsible for several fatal neurological disorders (sphingolipidoses)

## Sphingolipids
- membrane lipids based on an 18C amino alcohol (sphingosine) rather than glycerol
- parent compound is ceramide
    - sphingosine
    - FA joined to nitrogen of pshingosine in an amide linkage
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/QAqjWpt.png =250x)

### Sphingomyelin
- sphingomyelin is an abundant membrane lipid in nerve cells
- phosphorylcholine or phosphorylethanolamine esterified to C1 -OH of ceramide
- **phospholipid but not glycerophospholipid**

### Glycosphingolipids

## Cholesterol
- core structure consists of three 6-membered rings and one 5-membrered ring with 8C side chain
    - hydrophobic molecule apart from weakly polar -OH group on C3 (amphipathic lipid)
- cholesterol comprises 30-40% of plasma membrane lipids, playing a critical role in regulating membrane fluidity
- serves as a precursor for synthesis of many other biological molecules
    - steroid hormones
    - bile salts

## Lipids: key concepts
- lipids are predominantly hydrophobic molecules that can be esterified but cannot form polymers
- fatty acids are more energy dense than carbohydrates and can be stored in a more compact form
- glycerophospholipids are amphipathic molecules that can form the lipid bilayer component of cell membranes
    - bilary fluidity depends on length and saturation of its lipids and on the presence of cholesterol
    - glycolipids are abundant membrane lipids in cells of the CNS
    - cholesterol is an important lipid in regulating membrane fluidity and serves as a precursor for hormones and bile salts
