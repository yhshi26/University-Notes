## **Enzyme inhibition:**

- most drugs are enzyme inhibitors e.g. aspirin
    - reversible or irreversible
- reversible
    - e.g. substrate analogues
    - 3 classes
        - competitive
        - noncompetitive
        - uncompetitive

### **Competitive inhibitors:**
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/GS5ViOs.png =200x)
- inhibitor competes for active site
    - not converted to P
    - V~max~ unchaged
        - reverse inhib. by high [S]
    - K~m~ increases
        - apparent affinity for S reduced

### **Noncompetitive inhibitors:**
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/12uP5m7.png =200x)
- inhibitor binds to second binding site
- inhibitor binds to E or ES
- effectively removes enzyme
    - lowers V~max~
    - K~m~ unchanged

**Use changes in V~max~ and K~m~ to investigate inhibition**

### Also have uncompetitive inhib.:

- both V~max~ and K~m~ change

**pH and temperature effects:**

- enzymes have pH and temp optima

### **Allosteric regulation:**

- allosteric enzymes
    - allo = other, steric = shape
    - multi-subunit
        - co-operativity
        - sigmoidal kinetics
    - extra regulatory sites
        - bind modulator
            - pos or neg
        - change affinity

### **Feedback inhibition:**

- e.g. E1 inhibited by end product of pathway

## Enzyme examples
### **Coenzymes ATP:**

- ATP: adenosine triphosphate
    - energy carrier
        - ADP
        - AMP
- phosphate donor
    - phosphorylation

### **Coenzyme NAD, NADP:**

- nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate)
- NAD+ + 2H ← → NADH + H+
- NADP+ + 2H ← → NADPH + H+

### **Coenzymes FAD, FMN:**

- flavin adenine dinucleotide
- flavin mononucleotide
- FMN + H2 ← → FMNH2
- FAD + H2 ← → FADH2
