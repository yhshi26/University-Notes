## Overview of cholesterol synthesis
- occurs mainly in liver, intestine, steroidogenic tissues (gonads, adrenals)
- C atoms of cholesterol are derived from acetyl group of acetyl-coA
    - must be transported out of mitochondria
- starts in cytosol and is completed in ER
- cholesterol biosynthesis uses NADPH as a cofactor

## Summary of biosynthetic pathway
![](https://i.imgur.com/4R3GMDJ.png =450x)

### Step 1: acetyl coA to mevalonate
- occurs in cytoplasm
    - acetyl coA transported from mitochondira
    - citrate shuttle (ref. FA synthesis)
- 3 acetyl coA (2C) condense to form HMG coA (6C)
- HMG coA reduced to mevalonate in reaction catalysed by HMG coA reductase
    - rate limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/rfnRyTD.png =350x)

#### Rate limiting step in cholesterol synthesis: HMG coA reductase
- at least 3 different mechanisms regulate enzyme activity:
    1. phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinases inactivates the enzyme (reversed by phosphatases)
    2. enzyme t~1/2~ regulated by cholesterol levels: high [cholesterol] reduces t~1/2~
    3. high [cholesterol] reduces levels of HMG coA reductase mRNA
        - mediated by sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/8P8ONzI.png =150x)

#### Clinical correlation: statins work by inhibiting HMG coA reductase
- statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs that act as transition-state analogs binding like transition states to the HMG coA reductase
- for several years, lipitor was the best-selling drug in the world, with annual sales exceeding 10 billion 
    - the patent rights for lipitor have now expired, and generic versions are available

### Step 2: mevalonate to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP)
- 6C mevalonate converted to 5C isoprenoid IPP (decarboxylation)
- cholesterol built up by condensation of these 5C units
![](https://i.imgur.com/KOUy81Z.png =450x)

#### IPP is a precursor of many different biological molecules
![](https://i.imgur.com/73Ygvsx.png =250x)

### Step 3: IPP to squalene
- condensation of 6 5C IPP units to form 30C molecule squalene
- isoprenoids can be diverted to other synthetic pathways e.g. haem, coenzyme Q (ETC)
![](https://i.imgur.com/KFQzUuR.png =450x)

### Step 4: squalene to cholesterol
- open linear squalene undergoes multiple enzyme catalysed cyclisation reactions to yield lanosterol
- cholesterol is formed from lanosterol by multistep (19 reaction) pathway
    - steroid hormone synthesis
    - regulate membrane fluidity
    - bile acid/salt synthesis

## Cholesterol homeostasis
- cholesterol in:
    - CM remnants (exogenous, dietary CL)
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/xP1d8w5.png =200x)
- cholesterol out:
    - bile acid/salt synthesis
    - distribution to tissues (VLDL/LDL)
- cholesterol homeostasis:
    - regulate LDL uptake (LDL receptor)
    - regulate HMG coA reductase activity
    - regulate bile salt synthesis

### Common bile acids and salts
![](https://i.imgur.com/9H9dxsz.png =450x)

### Bile acids/salts
- polar carboxylic acid derivatives of cholesterol
    - amphipathic molecules (biological detergents)
    - emulsification of ingested fats in duodenum
    - synthesised in liver and stored in gall bladder
- approx. 750ml bile (containing ~500-10000mg bile acids/salts) are excreted per day into duodenum
    - 5-10% BS is excreted in feces and remainder reabsorbed and recycled to liver
    - **formation of bile salts from cholesterol represents the only pathway for cholesterol elimination from body**

### w3 and w6 essential fatty acids
- **w6 essential fatty acids**
    - precursors of prostaglandings, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes 
    - **pro-inflammatory**
- **w3 essential fatty acids**
    - cardioprotective
    - **anti-inflammatory**
    - anticarcinogenic

#### Arachadonic acid
- derived from C20 essential PUFA **C20:4 arachadonic acid (w 6 FA)**
- incorporated into membrane glycerophospholipids: released from GPL by action of phospholipase A2
    - precursor for synthesis of psotaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes
- exert their actions by binding to specific plasma membrane receptors
- PGs, TXs and LTs function as **local signalling molecules** and play important roles in inflammation and thrombosis

##### Prostaglandin, thromoxane and leukotrienes
- prostaglandins are formed from arachidonate by oxidation and cyclization in ER
    - cyclo-oxygenase (COX) 1 and 2
- thromboxanes synthesized from PGH~2~ by thromboxane synthase
- leukotrienes synthesised from arachidonate by family oxygenase (LOC) enzymes

##### Cox inhibitors: aspirin (acetylsalicylate)
- most widely NSAID used medications in world
    - anti-inflammatory
    - analgesic
    - antipyretic
- aspirin is an irreversible inhibitor 
    - inhibits COX1 and modifies activity of COX2 (ser 516)
    - inhibits TX formation and thus lessens risk of thrombosis
- selective COX2 inhibitor vioxx (merck) withdrawn from market in 2003 due to increased incidence of cv events

### (Glycero)phospholipids (GPLs)
- simplest GPL (parent compound) is phosphatidate
    - glycerol 3 phosphate esterified with 2 FA **(diacylglycerol)** with a PO~4~ at 3rd -OH group
    - if GPL contains an unsaturated FA, it will be at C2
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/wISsLEG.png =250x)
- a variety of polar alcohol compounds can be esterified to the PO~4~ group of phosphatidate, including:
    - choline (phosphatidylcholine or lecithin)
    - serine (phosphatidylserine)
    - ethanolamine (phosphatidylethanolamine)
    - inositol (phosphatidylinositol)
    - glycerol (phosphatidylglycerol)
- function:
    - structural components of membranes
    - cell signalling molecules

#### Synthesis of phosphatidate
- addition of 2 activated fatty acids (fatty acyl coA) to C1 and C2 of glycerol 3 phosphate
- glycerol comes from breakdown of TGs, DHAP comes from glycolysis
- end product is phosphatidate (also known as 1,2-diacylglycerol phosphate)
- may be used in GPL and/or TG synthesis

#### Degradation of glycerophospholipids
- reaction products include glycerol, mono and diacylglycerol and FAs may be further metabolised or recycled and may have some novel fucntions
    - arachidonate (PG,TX,LT synthesis)
    - PI metabolites (cell signalling)

#### Phosphatidylinositol: a membrane phospholipid important in cell signalling

### Sphingolipids
- components of all membranes but particularly abundant in myelin sheath
    - sphingomyelin is a major structural lipid of the myelin sheath 
- parent compound of this lipid class is ceramide
    - 18C amino alcohol (sphingosine) + FA
- sphingolipid metabolites (e.g. ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate) have been shown to be important mediators in the singaling cascades involved in apoptosis, proliferation, necrosis, inflammation, senescence and differentiation

#### Synthesis of ceramide
![](https://i.imgur.com/FzjuAxV.png =450x)

### Glycosphingolipids
- ceramides with one or more sugars in beta glycosidic linkage at the C1 -OH group
    - ceramide with one sugar = cerebroside
    - ceramide with more than 1 sugar (not including sialic acid) = globoside
    - ceramide with 3 or more sugars (one of which is sialic acid) = ganglioside
- glycosphingolipids particularly abundant in nerve cell membranes
    - nerve impulse transmission
    - cell-cell recognition
    - molecular recognition (binding glycoprotein hormones and bacterial toxins)
    - blood groups
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/DhjRDfE.png =450x)

#### Glycosphingolipid breakdown: part 1
- occurs in lysosomes
- most active in neural tissue
- glycosphingolipids are hydrolyzed to ceramide in lysosomes by action of:
    - glycosidases
    - galactosidases
    - hexosaminidases
    - neuraminidases
    - sulfatases
- enzyme deficiency causes accumulation of intermediates that result in lysosomal dysfunction and cell death
![](https://i.imgur.com/w77WKX8.png =400x)

#### GLycosphingolipid breakdown: part 2
- ceramide ultimately broken down to sphingosine and a FA
