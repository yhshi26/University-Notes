#### Review: monosaccharide breakdown

## Fructose metabolism
- major pathway for fructose metabolism bypasses major regulatory reaction in glycolysis
- minor pathway = conversion to fructose-6-P, in all cells
![](https://i.imgur.com/sHJocDS.png =250x)

- 2 ATP consumed (same as glucose)
- liver metabolises fructose to fructose-1-P more rapidly than glucose
- build up of fructose-1-P after a high sucrose meal can deplete cellular phosphate 
    - impaired oxidative phosphorylation, ATP production
    - potential liver damage
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/9Zz0gy5.png =250x)

### Enzyme deficiencies
- **fructokinase** deficiency
    - benign, high levels of fructose in blood and urine
    - fructose levels such that hexokinase metabolises it to fructose-6-P
- **aldolase B** deficiency
    - hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI)
    - build-up of fructose-1-P
    - depletion of phosphate and ATP
    - liver damage/failure/death
    - sucrose and fructose free diet

## Galactose metabolism
- 1 ATP used: same as for glucose to glucose-6-P
- galactose feeds into other pathways that use glucose-6-P, glucose-1-P and UDP-galactose
- conversion of galactose to galacticol only occurs at very high galactose levels; enzyme = **aldose reductase**
![](https://i.imgur.com/VxywQpR.png =250x)

### Enzyme deficiencies: galactosemia
- deficiency of **galactokinase**
    - mild disease; elevated levels of galactose in blood and urine
    - production of galacticol can lead to cataract formation
- deficiency of **uridyltransferase**
    - classic galactosemia
    - accumulaation of galactose-1-P and galacticol
    - depletion of cellular phosphate and ATP: tissue damage
        - wide range of tissues affected
        - liver damage, mental retardation, cataracts
    - removal of lactose from diet (newborn screening NB)

## Fructose from glucose
- **polyol pathway:** physiological pathway for **aldose reductase**
- particularly active in seminal fluid where fructose = major energy source for sperm cells
- also active in **lens,** retina, blood vessels and peripheral nerves

> this lecture: getting ATP from fructose and galactose, synthesis of ribose for nucleic acids

## Pentose phosphate pathway (hexose monophosphate shunt)
- **two** major products:
    - **ribose-5-P** for nucleotide synthesis
    - **NADPH** for reduction reactions in anabolic pathways **and** for protection against oxidative damage
- major pathway of glucose metabolism in:
    - rapidly dividing cells: major product = ribose-5-p
    - cells that synthesise fatty acids, cholesterol, steroids: major product = NADPH
    - cells exposed to high oxygen concentrations, e.g. rbcs, cornea: major product = NADPH
- steps:
    - oxidation
    - hydration
    - oxidative decarboxylation
    - isomerisation
    
### Oxidative phase
- products = 2 NADPH and 1 ribose-5-P
- rate-limiting step = step 1, catalysed by glucose-6-P dehydrogenase
- rate determined by availability of NADP^+^
![](https://i.imgur.com/KiQ1j6d.png =300x)

### Non-oxidative phase
- NADPH is major product of pentose phosphate pathway in:
    - rbcs: protection against oxidative damage
    - adipose tissue: fat synthesis
    - liver: fat synthesis
    - testes, ovaries: steroid synthesis
    - adrenals: steroid syntehsis
    - mammary tissue: fat synthesis
- ribose-5-P is recycled into the glycolysis pathway: **non-oxidative phase**
![](https://i.imgur.com/QscCkos.png =250x)
- purpose: convert 5-C products of oxidative phase to glycolysis substrates: 2 fructose-6-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P (GAP)
![](https://i.imgur.com/2s7H8qU.png =450x)

### NADPH and oxidative stress
- consequence of oxidative metabolism = production of damaging reactive oxygen species (OH^-^, O~2~^-^, H~2~O~2~)
- **antioxidants** protect cells against oxidative damage; major cellular antioxidant = **glutathione**
![](https://i.imgur.com/vkfDWfR.png =350x)
- NADPH required to replenish reduced glutathione (GSH)
- sole source of NADPH in rbcs, cornea = pentose phosphate pathway

### Drug-induced haemolytic anemia
- genetic deficiency in **glucose-6-p dehydrogenase** (reduced enzyme activity)
- problems arise only when affected individuals exposed to increased levels of oxidative stress
    - oxidant drugs e.g. primaquine (antimarlarial); chloramphenicol (broad-spectrum antibiotic)
    - infection
    - eating broad beans (favism)
- rbcs cannot produce sufficient NADPH to protect against oxidative damage: haemolyse

## Complex carbohydrates
- glycosaminoglycans
- glycoproteins
- glycolipids

### Monosaccharides in complex carbohydrates
![](https://i.imgur.com/1AZoA8I.png =350x)

| monosaccharide | activated form | present in |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| glucose | UDP-glc | glycoproteins, glycolipids | 
| galactose | UDP-gal | GAGs, glycoproteins, glycolipids | 
| mannose | GDP-man | glycoproteins | 
| fucose | GDP-fuc | glycoproteins, glycolipids | 
| N-acetylglucosamine | UDP-gluNAc | GAGs, glycoproteins | 
| N-acetylgalactosamine | UDP-galNAc | GAGs, glycoproteins, glycolipids | 
| glucuronic acid | UDP-glcUA | GAGs | 
| sialic acid (NANA) | CMP-NANA | glycoproteins, glycolipids | 

#### Activated monosaccharide synthesis
![](https://i.imgur.com/3fFFtQQ.png =350x)

### GAG synthesis
- core protein synthesised on rough ER into ER lumen
- glycosylated by membrane-bound transferases as it moves through ER, golgi
- monosaccharides added one-by-one to growing polysaccharide chain
- sulfation/iduronate synthesis then takes place before next monosaccharide added
- extruded to extracellular space
![](https://i.imgur.com/gmGrlEL.png =150x)

### Glycoprotein synthesis
- branches oligosaccharides linked to protein via either:
    - O-linkages to serine or threonine residues
    - N-linkage to asparagine
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/5ZfQ8mq.png =250x)

#### Lysosomal targeting
- lysosomal enzymes are glycoprotiens
- during glycosylation in golgi 'tagged' with mannose-6-P
- mannose-6-P 'tag' directs glycoprotein to lysosome
![](https://i.imgur.com/AeYHlKE.png =300x)

#### I-cell disease
- deficiency of enzyme involved in generating mannose-6-P 'tag' on glycoproteins
- lysosomal enzymes secreted into plasma (wrongly 'addressed')
- accumulation of non-degraded debris in lysosomes ("I" = inclusive bodies)
- mental deterioration, skeletal deformitis, death (â‰¤8 years)

### Degradation
- GAGs and glycoproteins digested in lysosomes
- oligosaccharide chains digested sequentially by specific acid hydrolases: 'last on, first off'
- deficiency of any one of the acid hydrolases causes degradation to stop with accumulation of remaining oligosaccharide chain
- lysosomal storage diseases:
    - mucopolysaccharidoses = diseases resulting in accumulation of GAG fragments
    - oligosaccharidoses = diseases resulting from accumulation of branched oligosaccharides from glycoproteins (or glycolipids)

#### Mucopolysaccharidoses
- accumulation of specific oligosaccharide causes cell death and tissue damage
- progressive diseases: normal at birth
- many organs affected, wide range of severity
- mental deficiency and physical deformity common
