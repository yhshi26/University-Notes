## Tissues
**Tissues are groups of cells that share structural features and are arranged in an orderly pattern that achieves the tissue's functions**
- cells → tissues → organs → organ systems

### Tissues are composed of:
- cells
- extracellular matrix = ECM (the spaces between the cells)
    - fibres
    - ground substance

### 4 basic tissue types:

- epithelilial tissue (epithilium):
    - covers body surfaces, lines body cavities, forms glands
- connective tissue:
    - underlies or supports the other 3 basic tissues, structurally and functionally
- muscle tissue:
    - made of contractile cells, responsible for movement
- nerve tissue:
    - recieves, transmits, and integrates information from outside and inside the body to control activities of the body
