## Overview lymphatic system
- **lymphatic system** consists of groups of cells, tissues, and organs that monitor body surfaces and internal fluid compartments and react to the presence of potentially harmful substances
- **lymphocytes** are the definitive cell type of the lymphatic system and the effector cells in the response of the immune system to harmful substances
- **immune system** the various lymphatic organs, lymphatic tissues and specialized cells
- **lymphatic vessels** connect parts of the system to the blood vascular system

#### Components:
- lymph and lymphatic vessels
- thymus, red bone marrow, GALT = gut-associated lymphoid tissue (primary)
- spleen, MALT = mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, **lymph nodes** (secondary)

#### Functions
- produce, maintain and distribute lymphocytes (primary organs)
- maintain normal blood vol and chemical composition of interstitial fluid
- alternative route for transport of hormones, nutrients and waste

> lecture structure: immune system → lymphatic drainage → spleen

## Immune system
### Cells of lymphatic system
- cells of immune system include **lymphocytes** and supporting cells
- major types of lymphocytes
    - B cells
    - T cells
    - NK cells (natural killer cells)
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/B270kME.png =250x)
- supporting cells: interact with lymphocytes, present antigens, reulate immune responses
    - monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, Langerhans' cells (skin), epithelioreticular cells (thymus)

#### Lymphocyte fucntions in adaptive immune response

|          | B cell | Cytotoxic T cell | Natural killer cell | 
| -------- | ------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| provides | antibody-mediated immunity | cell-mediated immunity | immunological surveillance |

### Antibodies recognize invaders and mediate the immune response
- **adaptive immunity**
    - acquires gradually by exposure
    - more specific, slower than innate immunity
- **B and T lymphocytes** become activated against specific invaders
- **antibodies (= glycoprotein of immunoglobin family)** recognize specific molecules from invaders **(antigens)**
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/5W2A6oE.png =150x)
- **antigen presenting cells (APCs)**, e.g. dendritic cells, macrophages, activate B and T cells by presenting the recognized antigens
- **memory lymphocytes** retain antibodies to respond more quickly

#### 5 major classes of immunoglobins

#### Antibody functions of antigen binding site
**Binding of antigen-binding site of an antibody with antigen causes:**
| Neutralization | Agglutination | Precipitation |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| antibody covers biologically active poriton of microbe or toxin | antibody cross-links cells (e.g. bacteria), forming a clump | antibody cross-links criculating particles (e.g. toxins), forming an insoluble antigen-antigbody complex |

#### Antibody function of F~c~ portion
**Exposed F~c~ portion following antigen binding by antigen promotes:**
| Complement fixation | Opsonization | Activation of NK cells | 
| ------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | 
| F~c~ region of antibody binds complement proteins, complement is activated | F~c~ region of antibody binds to receptors of phagocytic cells triggering phagocytosis | F~c~ region of antibody binds to an NK cell, triggering release of cytotoxic chemicals |

### How the immune system recognizes self vs invader
**Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)**
- 2 types
**MHC class I:**
- all nucleated cells express and present MCH class I molecules
- represents the range of all proteins synthesized in that cell
- → recognition of infected and transformed cells
![](https://i.imgur.com/sqFX5kp.png =150x)
**MHC class II:**
- only in cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, APCs
- binds to ingested antigens and present them at cell surface
- → signal to activate T cells
![](https://i.imgur.com/5KcdUTe.png =150x)

#### Types of T lymphocytes
**T cells:** long lived, 75% of circulating lymphocytes
Activation of T cells requires recognition of **both:**
- the **antigen** and
- **MHC** (the molecule presenting the antigen)
![](https://i.imgur.com/1z1Tgwb.png =250x)

**T cell receptor (TCR)** = surface protein with variable region that recognize specific antigens
**Helper T cells:**
- **CD4** receptor recognizes MHC class II
- produce cytokines: B cells → plasma cells
- activate macrophages, cytotoxic T cells
**Cytotoxic T cells:**
- **CD8** receptor recognizes MHC class I
- activated by interleukins from helper cells (IL-2)
- proliferate and kill recognized cells through perforins and granzymes triggering apoptosis

### Stimulation to activate cells for clonal selection
#### T cells

## Lymphatic drainage
- function: maintain normal blood volume and chemical composition of interstitial fluid (filter)
![](https://i.imgur.com/0DnBtIb.png =250x)

### Lymphatic functions
- key to tissue fluid return
- drainage of tissue fluid from interstitial spaces (approx. 8 litre/day)
- maintain appropriate **fluid balance** in body
- recover plasma proteins, hormones, enzymes (approx. 200g/day) that leack into interstitial space
- slow spread of neoplasia
- immune surveillance
- fat absorption from GIT
    - transport of **chyle** (rich in triglycerides, good energy source) to venous system
    - cisterna chyli: receives fatty chyle from intestine

#### More detail
![](https://i.imgur.com/jb2IZTc.png =350x)

#### Lymph capillaries in the tissue spaces
- unlike endothelial cells in blood vessels that are tightly sealed, **endothelial of the lymph vessels overlap**
- act as "flaps" to facilitate drainage of fluid, proteins and particles
![](https://i.imgur.com/YRTuvbP.png =300x)

### Clinical aspects
- **cancer** (breast lecture)
- **lymphoedema:** accumulation of interstitial fluid due to compromised lymphatic drainage
- **lymphadenitis:** type of lymphadenopathy → inflammation of lymph nodes (swelling)
- cancer spread by lymphatic system:
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/4TzJXhu.png =250x)

#### Lymphangitis
- **inflammation of lymphatic vessels →** streptococcus pygenes (most common cause)

## Spleen
- **spleen:** largest lymphoid organ (secondary)
- located in upper left quadrant of abdomen
- **adult spleen:** 12cm long, 7cm wide, 3-4cm thick, 150g (size of fist)
- curved 'wedge'-shape
- cannot normally be palpated on clinical examination
- **functions:**
    - **blood filtering** (morphologic and immunologic)
    - **immune surveillance of blood**
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/3u8nKII.png =250x)
    
### Spleen development
- begins to develop in **5th week** of gestation from mesenchymal cells in the **dorsal mesogastrium**
- rotation of stomach causes dorsal mesogastrium to balloon out to the left creating **lesser peritoneal sac** and **plenorenal ligament**
- dorsal mesentry between spleen and stomach froms: **gastrosplenic ligament**
- **shape of spleen roughly conforms to shape of adjacent organs**
- **splee connected to stomach and kidney by parts of greater omentum:**
    1. **gastrosplenic ligament:** anterior to splenic hilum, connects pleen to greater curvature of stomach
    2. **splenorenal ligament:** posterior to splenic hilum, connects hilum to left kidney
- between 2 ligaments = **lesser peritoneal sac**
![](https://i.imgur.com/FNEBIyZ.png =300x)

### Spleen functions
- **removal of:** bacteria, old red blood cells, iron
    - filters blood
- **storage of:** erythrocytes, granulocytes, platelets, haematopoietic stem cells in foetus
    - reservoir for blood cells
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ac9U2Z0.png =350x)

### Spleen structure
- connective tissue **capsule** supported by a fibrous trabecular framework consisting of **trabeculae**
- **splenic pulp:** reticular tissue containing reticular cells and fibers, many lymphocytes and other blood cells, macrophages, and APCs
- anatomically 2 functional components:
    1. **red pulp** (up to 80% of splenic mass)
    2. **white pulp** (= **splenic nodule**)
... separated by a **marginal zone**

| Lymphoid organ | T lymphocytes (%) | B lymphocytes (%) |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| thymus | 100 | 0 | 
| bone marrow | 10 | 90 | 
| spleen | 45 | 55 | 
| lymph nodes |  60 | 40 | 
| blood | 70 | 30 | 

#### Red pulp
- contains a lot of **blood**
- **function: blood filtering**
- consists of:
    1. **sinusoids** (splenic sinuses) - lined by **macrophages and endothelium**
    2. **splenic cords (cords of billroth)** - formed by reticular cells and fibres, located between sinusoids
- **lymphocytes (b+t cells), macrophages (phagocytosis of effete erythrocytes (old red blood cells)),** large numbers of **rbcs** (normal as well as senescent), **dendritic** cells and **granulocytes** - located in meshwork of reticular cells and fibres
- endothelium lining sinusoids: **fenestrated**, formed by long cells **(=stave cells)**
![](https://i.imgur.com/WxZSF5f.png =300x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ou8ZNuY.png =200x)

#### White pulp
- **function: initiates immune responses** to blood-borne antigens **→ lymphocytes**
- 2 compartments:
    1. periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS)
    2. splenic nodules (follicles)
- **PALS:** as central artioles enter red pulp, they are surrounded by **periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths:**
    - mainly a **t-cell** region
    - form irregular masses around central arteries
    - continuous with nodules
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/JCFIcJ5.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/Otyn98z.png =300x)
- **splenic nodules (follicles)** are continuous with PALS (periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths) and are typically found at bifurcation sites of **central arterioles (ring near top)**
    - composed primarily of **b-cells**
    - follicles may gain **germinal centres:**
        - form upon antigenic stimulation
        - contain macrophages + activated b-cells
- **marginal zone** (mainly macrophages + b-cells) = interface of red pulp with PALS + follicles → screens systemic circulation for antigens/pathogen

#### Clinical: splenectomy
- **trauma:** ruptured spleen
    - CT of ruptured spleen:
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/OI0JUsF.png =300x)
- **enlarged spleen**
- **haematological conditions:** e.g. haemolytic anaemia, hypersplenism, thalassemia
- **autoimmune:** e.g. immune thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
- **cancer:** e.g.chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy cell leukaemia

**=> Impaired immune system:** pneumonia, meningitis, influenza, sepsis, malaria parasitic diseases, gram-negative bacterial diseases from animal bites.
