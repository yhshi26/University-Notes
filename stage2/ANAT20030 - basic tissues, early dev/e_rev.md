## Histology
### Overview basic tissues
Tissues: 
- cells → tissues → organs → organ systems
- composed of: 
    - cells
    - extracellular matrix (ECM) = spaces between cells
        - fibres 
        - ground substance
- 4 types of tissues:
    - epithelial tissue (epithilium)
        - covers body surfaces
        - lines body cavities
        - forms glands
    - connective tissue
        - underlies or supports other 3 tissue types structurally and functionally
    - muscle tissue
        - made of contractile cells
        - responsible for movement
    - nerve tissue
        - receives, transmits, and integrates information from inside and outside the body to control body activities

Questions:
- what do tissues form?
- what are tissues composed of?
- what are 4 types of tissues?
    - what are their functions?

### Microscopy
- key histological staining technique:
    - hemotoxylin and eosin (H and E):
        - hemematoxylin:
            - basophilic: DNA, RNA (blueish)
                - stains nucleus
        - eosin:
            - acidophilic/eosinophilic: proteins (amino-groups) (pink)
                - stains cytoplasm
- challenges in interpreting images:
    - assessing object sizes
    - variety of appearances resulting from slicing 3D structures in different planes
- artifacts: consequences of procedures to prepare the tissue
    - tissue folding
    - chatter artifact
    - tissue tearing
    - bubbles

Questions:
- is histological sectioning reversible or irreversible?
- how do you prepare a histological section? (7 steps)
- what staining technique can be used?
    - what does it stain, and what colour does it stain it?
- what are challenges (3) in microscopy?
    - what are the types of artifacts (4)?
