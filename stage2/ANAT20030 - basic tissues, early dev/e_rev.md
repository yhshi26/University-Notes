## Histology
### Overview basic tissues
**Tissues:** 
- **hierarchy:** cells → tissues → organs → organ systems
- **composed of:**
    - cells
    - extracellular matrix (ECM) = spaces between cells
        - fibres 
        - ground substance
- **4 types of tissues:**
    - **epithelial tissue (epithilium)**
        - covers body surfaces
        - lines body cavities
        - forms glands
    - **connective tissue**
        - underlies or supports other 3 tissue types structurally and functionally
    - **muscle tissue**
        - made of contractile cells
        - responsible for movement
    - **nerve tissue**
        - receives, transmits, and integrates information from inside and outside the body to control body activities

        - from outside to inside:
            - articular cartilage (epiphysis)
            - **periosteum:** tough, vascularized, fibrous sheath that superficially covers bone where there is no cartilage
                - nourishes and protects bone
                - attachment site for ligaments and tendons
                - superficial layers are high on fibers

        - **osteoclasts** are large with multiple nuclei, derived from monocytes, and dissolve in the matrix to realease calcium through **osteolysis**
- **types of bone:**
    - **woven bone:**
        - immature bone (osteoid)
            - first formed during fetal development or during fracture repair

    - **lamellar bone:**
        - mature bone
        - concentric bands of collagen
            - fibres oriented in 1 direction per layer, layers alternate direction → increases strength

                - no osteons
- **bone formation:**
    - **intramembranous ossification:**
        - ossification within a membrane, takes ~8 wks
        - special cells (mesenchyme: embryonic connective tissue) secrete protein matrix that later mineralizes (becomes hard)
            1. mesnchymal stem cells differentiate into osteoprogenitor cells, then osteoblasts
            2. osteoblasts surround themselves in bone matrix
            3. bone matrix calcifies into trabeculae with spaces containing red bone marrow
            4. periosteum deelops
            5. outer layers of spongy bone are replaced with compact bone
        - primarily flat and irregular bones (e.g. facial bones, skull)
    - **endochondral ossification:**
        - replacement of cartilage by bone, takes ~12 wks
        - mesenchyme turns into cartilage that is later replaced by bone
            1. fetal hyaline cartilage model develops
            2. cartilage calfifies and periosteal bone collar forms around diaphysis
            3. primary ossification center forms in diaphysis
            4. secondary ossification centers form in epiphyses
            5. bone replaces cartilage except the articular cartilage and epiphyseal plates
            6. epiphyseal plate ossify and form epiphyseal lines
        - majority of bones in skeletal system
        - associated with growth in length (e.g. humerus, femur)
            - **epiphyseal (growth) plate zones:**
                1. resting cartilage: small scattered chondrocytes
                2. proliferating cartilage: larger chondrocytes arranged like coins
                3. hypertrophic cartilage: large, maturing chondrocytes
                4. calcified cartilage: dead chondrocytes in calcified cartilage
                5. resorption: osteoclasts dissolve cartilage, osteoblats and capillaries invade area
- **bone remodelling:**
    - old bone is resorbed by osteoclasts
    - replaced with new osteoid, secreted by osteoblasts
    - renewal rate for compact bone: 4% per year
    - renewal rate for trabecular bone: 20% per year
    - whole skeleton replaced every 7-10 years
- **bone pathologies**
    - post-fracture remodelling:
        1. inflammation directly after injury
        2. soft callus (cartilagenous)
        3. hard callus (calcified)
        4. remodelling: for strength
    - **achondroplasia → no cartilage formation:**
        - affects endochondral ossification
        - epiphyseal plates close before bones mature and normal bone length is reached
            - people with achondroplasia have short stature
        - bones derived from intramembranous ossification are not affected
    - **osteopenia and osteoporosis → excessive bone resorption:**
        - typically affects older women
        - excessive osteoclast activity and loss in bone density
            - bones fracture more easily
            - patients may appear more stooped
        - bone density measured by DEXA scan that gives a T-score (T score = comparison of patient's bone density to that of a healthy 30 year old of same gender)
            - -1 ot -2.5 → osteopenia
            - <-2.5 → osteoporosis
    - **osteopetrosis → excessive bone formation:**
        - umbrella term for pathologies with increased bone density
        - defective skeletal remodelling
        - osteoclasts fail to resorb bone
        - osteoblast activity continues without counter-regulatory action of osteoclasts
            - remodelling fails
            - bone becomes very dense but also brittle (remodelling confers strength) → fracture more easily

    - regulating entering and exiting material
        - voluntary control over swallowing, defecation, urination
    - maintain body temperature
        - contraction → energy → heat
    - affect blood flow
- **structure:**
    - **muscle cell = myofibre**
        - bundle of myofilaments → myofibrils → myofibre = muscle fibre
        - bundle of myofibres → bundle of muscle fibres → bundle of fascicles = muscle
        - elongated, highly differentiated cell
    - **in organs:**
        - **epimysium:** external sheath of dense irregular connective tissue surrounding entire muscle
        - **septa:** of epimysium extends inward, carrying larger nerves, blood vessels, and lymphatics of muscle
        - **perimysium:** thin connective tissue layer that surrounds fascicles
            - nerves, blood vessels, and lymphatics penetrate perimysium to supply fascicles
    - **in cells:**

        - **endomysium:** thin layer of reticular fibres and scattered fibroblasts, surrounds external lamina of individual muscle fibres
            - nerve fibres and capillaries form a rich network in the endomysium bringing signals and oxygen to muscle fibres

        - **myofibril:** bundle of myofilaments
            - **myofilament:** myosin and f-actin organized in a symmetric pattern
- **muscle types:**
    - general: all muscles contract, origin: mesoderm
    - **skeletal muscle:** bundles of long, multinucleated cells with **cross-striations** (alternating light and dark bands due to myofibril organization of actin and myosin filaments)
        - contraction is quick, forceful, and voluntary
    - **cardiac muscle:** long, mononucleated **myocytes**  with cross-striations that branch to join adjacent cells that are bound at **intercalated discs** (unique to cardiac muscle) composed of **desmosomes** and **fascia adherens** junctions, and **gap junctions** 
        - contraction is vigorous, rhythmic, and involuntary
    - **smooth/visceral muscle:** collections of long, mononucleated **fusiform** cells with no striations
        - contraction is slow, and involuntary
- **contraction:**
    - **recieving the signal:**
        1. ACh released from axon terminal bids to receptors on sarcolemma
        2. action potential is generated and travels down T tubule
        3. Ca^2+^ released from sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to voltage change
        4. Ca^2+^ binds troponin, cross-bridges form between actin and myosin
        5. Ach-esterase removes ACh from synaptic cleft
        6. Ca^2+^ transported back into sarcoplasmic reticulum
        7. tropomyosin binds active sites on actin causing cross-bridge detachment
    - **propagating signal to all myofibrils:**
        - **T tubules:** sarcolemme intensions that penetrate deep in sarcoplasm
