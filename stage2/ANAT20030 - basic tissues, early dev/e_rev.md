    - **epithelial tissue (epithilium)**
        - covers body surfaces
        - lines body cavities

        4. remodelling: for strength
    - **achondroplasia → no cartilage formation:**
        - affects endochondral ossification
        - epiphyseal plates close before bones mature and normal bone length is reached
            - people with achondroplasia have short stature
        - bones derived from intramembranous ossification are not affected
    - **osteopenia and osteoporosis → excessive bone resorption:**
        - typically affects older women
        - excessive osteoclast activity and loss in bone density
            - bones fracture more easily
            - patients may appear more stooped
        - bone density measured by DEXA scan that gives a T-score (T score = comparison of patient's bone density to that of a healthy 30 year old of same gender)
            - -1 ot -2.5 → osteopenia
            - <-2.5 → osteoporosis
    - **osteopetrosis → excessive bone formation:**
        - umbrella term for pathologies with increased bone density
        - defective skeletal remodelling
        - osteoclasts fail to resorb bone
        - osteoblast activity continues without counter-regulatory action of osteoclasts

        - function: secrete products (mucus, sweat, saliva, digestive enzymes) onto surfaces (skin) or cavitues via ducts
- **3 exocrine secretion types:**
    - **merocrine:**
        1. product delivered in membrane-bound vesicles to apical surface
        2. vesicles fuse with plasma membrane and extrude contents via **exocytosis**
        - most common mechanism
        - no loss of cell material
        - e.g. pancreas, sweat, salivary glands
    - **apocrine:**
        1. secretory vesicles accumulate in apical portion of cell
        2. apical portion sheds off
        3. cell regrows
    - **holocrine:**
        1. cells disintegrate at apical surface
        2. cells replenished by cell division in basal layer

#### Skin
- **the integument covers the body**
    - **composed of:**
        - skin and
        - skin appendages (nails, hair follicles, glands)
- **components and layers:**
    - **layers (superficial to deep):**
        1. epidermis
        2. dermis
            - papillary layer
            - reticular layer
        3. subcutaneous layer/hypodermis/subcutis
    - **components:**
        - **epidermis:**
            - hair shafts
            - sweat and gland duct pores
        - **papillary layer:**
            - tactile corpuscle
            - sebaceous gland
        - **reticular layer:**
            - arrector pili muscle
            - sweat gland duct
            - hair follicle
            - lamellated corpuscle
            - nerve fibers
        - **subcutaneous layer (hypodermis):**
            - sweat gland
            - arteries and veins (which form the cutaneous plexus)
- **thick skin vs thin skin:**
    - thick skin epidermis has 5 layers, thin skin epidermis has 4 layers
        1. stratum corneum
            - consists of keratin
            - sheds dead cells (desquamation)
        2. stratum lucidum **(thick skin only)**
            - densely packed cells, no nuclei or organelles
            - appears glassy
        3. stratum granulosum
            - cells keratinize
            - granules with keratohyalin
        4. stratum spinosum
            - synthesizes keratin (keratinocytes), langerhans cells and melanocytes
        5. stratum basale
            - connected to basal lamina
            - cells devide (regeneration)
            - contains epidermal stem cells, melanocytes and merkel cells
    - **thick skin vs thin skin:**
        - thick skin:
            - found on palms and soles
            - epidermis: 400-1400 μm
        - thin skin:
            - found everywhere else on body
            - epidermis: 75-150 μm
- **4 cell types in epidermis:**
    - **keratinocytes:** epithelial cells that **separate organism from external environment** 
        - account for 85% of cells in epidermis
    - **melanocytes:** **pigment producing cells** in basal layer
        - account for 5% of cells in epidermis
    - **langerhans' (dendritic) cells:** **antigen-presenting cells** involved in immune signalling in all layers
        - account for 2-5% of cells in epidermis
    - **merkel's cells:** **sensitive mechanoreceptor cells** associated with sensory nerve endings in basal layer
        - account for 6-10% of cells in epidermis
- **sensory receptors:**
    - 2 types: with or without capsules of collagen and modified schwann cells
        - **no capsule:**
            - nerve ending, root hair plexus
                - temperature, pain, itch
            - merkel cells
                - light touch, texture
        - **capsule:**
            - lamellated (pacinian) corpuscles
                - pressure, high-frequency vibration
            - krause end bulbs
                - low-frequency vibration, cold
            - meissner (tactile) corpuscles
                - light touch
            - ruffini corpuscles
                - tissue distortion
- **skin appendages:** are derived from growth of epidermal epithelium in development
    - **hair follicles** produce **hair**
        - hair structure:
            - outside = shaft, embedded = root
            - medulla → cortex → cuticle (center to surface)
            - dermal papilla:
                - kertinocytes proliferate to extend hair root (hair growth)
    - **sebaceous glands** produce **sebum**
        - sebaceous gland structure:
            - attached to hair
            - acinar type gland
            - holocrine secretion called sebum:
                - helps maintain stratum corneum and hair shafts (so mainly on face and scalp)
                - exerts weak antibacterial and antifungal properties
    - **eccrine sweat glands** produce **sweat**
        - everywhere on skin, especially palms, soles, forehead and axillae
        - stratfied cuboidal
        - ducts open to skin surface
        - thermoregulation and extretion (merocrine secretion → only secretions leave cell, so cell stays intact)
    - **apocrine sweat glands** produce **sweat with carbohydrates, lipids and proteins**
        - in axillae and genital regions
            - not functional until puberty
        - simple cuboidal
        - ducts open into hair follicles
        - produce viscous secretion (merocrine) that is initially odourless but may acquire scent due to bacterial decomposition
