## Histology
### Overview basic tissues
Tissues: 
- cells → tissues → organs → organ systems
- composed of: 
    - cells
    - extracellular matrix (ECM) = spaces between cells
        - fibres 
        - ground substance
- 4 types of tissues:
    - epithelial tissue (epithilium)
        - covers body surfaces
        - lines body cavities
        - forms glands
    - connective tissue
        - underlies or supports other 3 tissue types structurally and functionally
    - muscle tissue
        - made of contractile cells
        - responsible for movement
    - nerve tissue
        - receives, transmits, and integrates information from inside and outside the body to control body activities

Questions:
- what do tissues form?
- what are tissues composed of?
- what are 4 types of tissues?
    - what are their functions?

### Microscopy
- key histological staining technique:
    - hemotoxylin and eosin (H and E):
        - hemematoxylin:
            - basophilic: DNA, RNA (blueish)
                - stains nucleus
        - eosin:
            - acidophilic/eosinophilic: proteins (amino-groups) (pink)
                - stains cytoplasm
- challenges in interpreting images:
    - assessing object sizes
    - variety of appearances resulting from slicing 3D structures in different planes
- artifacts: consequences of procedures to prepare the tissue
    - tissue folding
    - chatter artifact
    - tissue tearing
    - bubbles

Questions:
- is histological sectioning reversible or irreversible?
- how do you prepare a histological section? (7 steps)
- what staining technique can be used?
    - what does it stain, and what colour does it stain it?
- what are challenges (3) in microscopy?
    - what are the types of artifacts (4)?

### Connective tissue
- **function:** underlies or supports other 3 tissue types structurally and functionally
- **types:**
    - **connective tissue proper:**
        - **loose:**
            - **areolar:** 
                - composition: cells, fibres and ground substance in equal parts
                - location: layer beneath epithelial lining of many organs
                - function: fill spaces between fibres of muscle and nerve
            - **reticular:**
                - composition: type III collagen fibres
                - location: bone marrow, liver, lymph nodes, spleen
                - function: forms delicate network for cells in hemopoietic tissue and lymphoid organs
                - (only visible in silver staining)
            - **adipose:**
                - composition: adipocyte cells
                - location: deep to skin, especially at sides, buttocks, breasts, padding around eyes and kidneys
                - function: provide padding and cushion shocks, insulate (reduce heat loss), store energy
        - **dense:** few cells, little ground substance
            - **irregular:**
                - composition: randomly distributed bundles of type I collagen, some elastic fibres
                - location: dermis of skin, organ capsules
                - function: provide resistance to tearing from all directions and elasticity
            - **regular:**
                - composition: bundles of parallel type I collagen
                - location: prominent in tendons and ligaments
                - function: provide strength but little strech, binding together components of musculoskeletal system
            - **elastic:**
                - composition: bundles with central core of elastin associated with network of fibrillin microfibrils
                - location: ligaments of spinal column, ligaments supporting transitional epithelia, blood vessel walls
                - function: stabilizes position of vertebrae and penis, cushions shocks, permits expansion and contraction of organs
    - **fluid connective tissue:**
        - **blood:**
            - contained in cardiovascular system
        - **lymph:**
            - contained in lymphatic system
    - **supporting connective tissue:**
        - **cartilage:**
            - solid, rubbery matrix
            - hyaline, elastic, fibrous cartilage
        - **bone:**
            - solid, crystalline matrix
- **cell types in connective tissue:**
    - **mesenchyme:**
        - mesenchymal cells: embryological/fetal cells that form connective tissue
    - **fibroblasts:**
        - principle cell of connective tissue
        - create and maintain connective tissue, fibres and matrix (collagen, elastic and reticular fibres, complex carbohydrates of ground substance)
            - **collagen fibres:**
                - most abundant: 30% body dry weight
                - formed by collagen proteins
                - fibrillar collagens (I-III) form collagen fibres
                - network or sheet-forming collagens (IV, X): major structural proteins of external laminae and all epithelial basal laminae
                - linking/anchoring collagens (VII, ...): short collagens that link fibrillar collagens to another and other compoennts of ECM, link to basal lamina
            - **reticular fibres:**
                - formed by collagen proteins
            - **elastic fibres:**
                - formed by elastin protein

    - **adipocytes:** 
        - store fat and produce hormones, differentiate from mesenchymal stem cells, found in loose connective and adipose tissue
        - white adipose: specialized for storage of triglycerides (fat) as energy reserve, but also has metabolic and structural roles
        - brown adipose: specialized form of adipose tissue prominent in babies; metabolises triglycerides for heat under control of nervous system
    - **hematopoietic stem cell-derived:**
        - **mast cells:** tissue resident immune cells involved in immediate hypersensitivity and allergy
            - ovoid, spherical nucleus 
            - store secretory products (mediators of inflammation) in granules and release upon activation
            - develop in bone marrow, differentiate in connective tissue
            - found in connective tissue and mucous membranes but not brain or spinal cord
        - **tissue macrophages:** tissue resident immune cells with prominent phagocytic abilities; major role in immune system
        - **lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, plasma cells:** other immune cells usually in transit or response to inflammation
- **ground substance:**
    - fills space between cells and fibres
    - is hydrated, viscous and transparent
        - complex mixture of 2 macromolecules:
            - glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)
            - proteoglycans

                - cell adhesion and movement
            - water (interstitial fluid)
- **tendons/ligaments/cartilage:**
    - **tendons:** attach skeletal muscle to bone, strength but little stretch and poor vascularization
        - dense regular connective tissue
            - densely packed with bundles of parallel type I collagen, ground substance is sparse
            - fibroblast (tendinocytes) oriented, elongated nuclei
    - **ligaments:** attach bone to bone or cartilage, strength and stretch
        - similar to tendons but:
            - less dense and
            - more elastic fibres
    - **cartilage:** tough, durable supporting connective tissue
        - densely packed with GAGs and proteoglycans, chondrocytes receive nutrients by diffusion from surrounding connective tissue (perichondrium)
            - no vascularization
            - no nerves
        - provides low-friction surfaces, structural support and cushioning
