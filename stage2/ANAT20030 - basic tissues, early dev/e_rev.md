## Histology
### Overview basic tissues
**Tissues:** 
- **hierarchy:** cells → tissues → organs → organ systems
- **composed of:**
    - cells
    - extracellular matrix (ECM) = spaces between cells
        - fibres 
        - ground substance
- **4 types of tissues:**
    - **epithelial tissue (epithilium)**
        - covers body surfaces
        - lines body cavities
        - forms glands
    - **connective tissue**
        - underlies or supports other 3 tissue types structurally and functionally
    - **muscle tissue**
        - made of contractile cells
        - responsible for movement
    - **nerve tissue**

                - no osteons
- **bone formation:**
    - **intramembranous ossification:**
        - ossification within a membrane, takes ~8 wks
        - special cells (mesenchyme: embryonic connective tissue) secrete protein matrix that later mineralizes (becomes hard)
            1. mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into osteoprogenitor cells, then osteoblasts
            2. osteoblasts surround themselves in bone matrix
            3. bone matrix calcifies into trabeculae with spaces containing red bone marrow
            4. periosteum develops
            5. outer layers of spongy bone are replaced with compact bone
        - primarily flat and irregular bones (e.g. facial bones, skull)
    - **endochondral ossification:**
        - replacement of cartilage by bone, takes ~12 wks
        - mesenchyme turns into cartilage that is later replaced by bone
            1. fetal hyaline cartilage model develops
            2. cartilage calfifies and periosteal bone collar forms around diaphysis
            3. primary ossification center forms in diaphysis
            4. secondary ossification centers form in epiphyses
            5. bone replaces cartilage except the articular cartilage and epiphyseal plates
            6. epiphyseal plate ossify and form epiphyseal lines
        - majority of bones in skeletal system
        - associated with growth in length (e.g. humerus, femur)

                2. proliferating cartilage: larger chondrocytes arranged like coins
                3. hypertrophic cartilage: large, maturing chondrocytes
                4. calcified cartilage: dead chondrocytes in calcified cartilage
                5. resorption: osteoclasts dissolve cartilage, osteoblats and capillaries invade area
- **bone remodelling:**
    - old bone is resorbed by osteoclasts
    - replaced with new osteoid, secreted by osteoblasts
    - renewal rate for compact bone: 4% per year
    - renewal rate for trabecular bone: 20% per year

- **bone pathologies**
    - post-fracture remodelling:
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/yX5yUbS.png =400x)
    - **achondroplasia → no cartilage formation:**
        - affects endochondral ossification
        - epiphyseal plates close before bones mature and normal bone length is reached
            - people with achondroplasia have short stature
        - bones derived from intramembranous ossification are not affected
    - **osteopenia and osteoporosis → excessive bone resorption:**
        - typically affects older women
        - excessive osteoclast activity and loss in bone density
            - bones fracture more easily
            - patients may appear more stooped
        - bone density measured by DEXA scan that gives a T-score (T score = comparison of patient's bone density to that of a healthy 30 year old of same gender)
            - -1 ot -2.5 → osteopenia
            - <-2.5 → osteoporosis
    - **osteopetrosis → excessive bone formation:**
        - umbrella term for pathologies with increased bone density
        - defective skeletal remodelling
        - osteoclasts fail to resorb bone
        - osteoblast activity continues without counter-regulatory action of osteoclasts
            - remodelling fails
            - bone becomes very dense but also brittle (remodelling confers strength) → fracture more easily

        - cooper's ligaments firmly attach mammary gland to overlying skin
            - **clinical implications:** accumulation of fluid may cause skin to have dimpled appearance due to skin being tethered by cooper's ligaments
    - function: produe milk to feed baby (females, developed)
- **lymphatics:** the lymphatic flow fo the breast is of great clinical significance due to metastatic dissemination occuring usually by lymphatic routes
    - lymph drains from nipple to areola to mammary glands to lymphatic plexus

            - pectoral
            - subscapular
            - humeral 
            - central
        - majority of remaining draings medially to **parasternal nodes** or opposite breast
        - some drains to **abdominal, deep cervical and supraclavicular nodes**
        - **clinical implications:** interference with lymphatic drainage by cancer may cause:
            1. axillary venous thrombosis: obstruction of blood passage, life threatening 
            2. lymphoedema: impaired lymph flow from upper limb to axilla
                - excess fluid in subcutaneous tissues

### Spermatogenesis and oogenesis
- **spermatocytogenesis (spermatogenesis):**
    - begins at puberty 
    - primordial cells remain dormant until puberty 
    - meiotic divisions produce 4 spermatids
    - - ![](https://www.sarthaks.com/?qa=blob&qa_blobid=16520447564500019689 =250x)
    - spermatids mature into spermatozoa via **spermiogenesis** in the **epididymis**
        1. formation of acrosome 
        2. condensation of the nucleus 
        3. formation of neck, middle and tail 
        4. shedding of most of the cytoplasm
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/nInTLHj.png =450x)
    - spermatozoon is mature sperm, **structure:**
        - head (with acrosome), tail, neck (centriol), midpiece (mitochondria), principle piece, end piece
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/FFwNxIU.png =350x)
    - **testis structures involved:**
        - sertoli cells (blood-testes barrier, ‘nurse cell’), leydig cells (produce testosterone), spermatogonia, spermatocyes, spermatids
        - accessory glands produce seminal plasma for the spermatozoa (seminal plasma + spermatozoa = ejaculate) and helps transport sperm, providing them with energy and a pH they can survive in
- **oogenesis:** 
    - begins before birth 
    - primordial germ cells form oogonia 
    - development stops at prophase of meiosis 1 to form primary oocytes, surrounded by follicular cells = primordial follicle 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/YqrpVwC.png =250x)
    - maturation completes meiosis and involves 3 stages: 
        1. primary 
        2. secondary (graafian follicle)
        3. preovulatory (ovarian follicle, folliculogenesis)
    - when the second primordial follicle is mature, the first primordial follicle is stimulated by LH which results in meiosis 1 being completed producing a secondary oocyte and polar body
    - secondary oocyte stops development at metaphase of meiosis 2 and will not complete division until fertilisation
    - **oocyte components:**
        - zona pellucida: thick coat
        - follicular antrum: part filled with fluid
        - cumulus oophorus: cluster of cells surrounding oocyte

### First week of development: ovulation to implantation
- **ovulation:** an oocyte is discharged from the ovary to the oviduct
    - when an oocyte is ovulated it is in **metaphase II** and is **surrounded by the zona pellucida and some granulosa cells** 
- **insemination:** spermatozoa enter via the vagina
    - spermatozoa are motile, swimming against a current
    - spermatozoa are transported by smooth muscle contractions (prostaglandins) to reach the **oviduct (fallopian tube):**
        - once spermatozoa reach oviduct, they form a sperm reservoir for 3-4 days, then bind temporarily for 2 sec-1 min
        - sperm then compete to fertilize the oocyte
- before the spermatozoa can fertilize the oocyte, it must undergo:
    - **capacitation:** the glycoprotein coat and seminal plasma proteins are removed from the head
    - **acrosome reaction:** acrosine and trypsin-like substances are released to penetrate the zona pellucida
- fertilization: spermatozoon must penetrate the **corona radiate**, the **zona pellucida** and the **oocyte cell membrane**
- when the spermatozoon enters the oocyte:
    - it finishes the **meiosis II** and forms the **female pronucleus**
    - the **zona pellucida becomes impenetrable** to prevent polyspermy 
    - the **head of the sperm separates**, swells and forms the **male pronucleus**
- the results of fertilization: 
    - restoration of the diploid number of chromosomes 
    - determination of chromosomal sex 
    - initiation of cleavage
- **cleavage** = series of mitotic divisions that results in an increase in **blastomeres**
    - after 3 divisions compaction occurs to give a tightly grouped ball of cells, which divide to form a 16-cell **morula**
    - a cavity appears in the morula to form a **blastocyst**
    - the inner cell mass develops at the time of compaction will develop into the **embryo**, and the outer cell mass will form the **trophoblast**
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/7rmltnH.png =450x)
- the **blastocyst** implants in the **endometrium** along the **anterior or posterior wall**

### Second week of development: bilaminar germ disc
- at this point the **blastocyst is partially embedded** in the **endometrial stroma**
- trophoblast =
    - **cytotrophoblast** – inner - actively proliferating layer
    - **syncytiotrophoblast** – outer - erodes maternal tissues
- syncytiotrophoblast forms lacunae and **maternal blood enters the lacunar network** = primitive uteroplacental circulation
- inner cell mass/embryoblast =
    - **epiblast** – gives rise to amnioblasts
    - **hypoblast** – endoderm cells are continuous with exocoelomic membrane which surround the primitive yolk sac
- extraembryonic mesoderm =
    - **somatopleuric** mesoderm 
    - **splanchnopleuric** mesoderm 
- second week is referred to as the **‘week of twos’**:
    - **trophoblast** splits in two (cyto and syncytio)
    - **embryoblast** splits in two (epi and hypo)
    - two **cavities** formed (amniotic and yolk sac)
    - **extraembryonic mesoderm** splits in two (somatopleuric and splanchnopleuric)

### Third week of development: trilaminar germ disc
- **gastrulation:** process that reorganizes bilaminar disc into trilaminar disc with 3 germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm
    - begins with appearance of primitive streak on epiblast surface
    - primitive streak elongates to cranial and caudal ends
        - cranial end forms thickening (primitive node)
    - epiblast cells invaginate to form endoderm and mesoderm, and epiblast becomes ectoderm (cells leave epiblast and delaminate, those that don't remain as endoderm
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/7nHRuB8.png =350x)
    - prenotochordal cells (derived from the mesoderm) invaginating in the primitive pit move forwards until they reach the prechordal plate, forming the notochordal plate, which becomes the notochord
    - notochord forms midline axis and forms basis of axial skeleton
    - ![](https://www.med.umich.edu/lrc/coursepages/m1/embryology/embryo/images/gastrulation_1.gif =250x)
    - during notochord and neural tube formation, the mesoderm splits into 3 regions:
        - **paraxial mesoderm:** **somites** form segmental plate near midline 
            - somitomeres along the midline and are replaced by somites
            - the somites surround the neural tube
            - **somite divisions:**
                - splanchnic
                - primitive gut
                - somatic
                - intermediate
                - paraxial
        - **intermediate cell mass (segmented):** mesonephros
            - **intermediate mesoderm derivatives:** urogenital system
        - **lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) (unsegmented):** splits into **somatic** and **splanchnic layer**
            - differentiates after somites form around neural tube
            - **somatic mesoderm derivatives:** body wall and limbs
            - **splanchnic mesoderm derivatives:** organs
- **basic derivatives of the 3 germ layers:**
    - **ectoderm:**
        - surface ectoderm (epidermis)
        - nervous system
        - neural crest cell derivatives
            - melanocytes, skull bones, adrenal medulla
    - **endoderm:**
        - dermis
        - muscles
        - skeleton except in head
        - urogenital organs except bladder
        - blood, vasculature, spleen
    - **mesoderm:**
        - digestive system
            - gut, liver, pancreas
        - respiratory system
        - bladder
        - thyroid, parathyroid

### Fourth week: nervous system, embryonic folding, pharyngial/branchial arches and derivatives
- **nervous system development:**
    - major parts of central nervous system **i.e. brain and spinal cord** form by **neurulation**
    - **neurulation:** is formation of the precursors for the nervous system:
        1. **neural plate** induction:
            - the neural plate forms when **ectoderm** in the midline is induced by the **notochord** below to form **neuroectoderm**
        2. **neural tube** formation:
            1. **primary neurulation:** where neural tube forms from neural plate
                - the neural tube forms when the **neural plate** rises to form **neural folds** along its length on each side (**neural groove** forms in the midline)
                - cells on the crests of the **neural folds** form **neural crest cells** between the **neural plate** and **surface ectoderm**
                - **neural crest cells** fuse the **neural folds** together to form the **neural tube**
                - ![](https://i.imgur.com/9mjbJBZ.png =350x)
            2. **secondary neurulation:** where caudal end of neural tube closes
                - occurs at end of spinal cord
                - neural tube forms solid rod of neural tissue that canalises (hollows out) and links up with the rest of the neural tube
                - ![](https://i.imgur.com/7kUfO4Y.png =350x)
    - **cns development:**
        - **neural tube** closes to form 3 vesicles in the anterior **cranial** region:
            - **prosencephalon/forebrain**
            - **mesencephalon/midbrain**
            - **rhombencephalon/hindbrain**
            - derivatives:
                - ![](https://i.imgur.com/wkT13v5.png =550x)
        - **lumen (gap) of neural tube** forms **ventricles** (spaces filled with cerebrospinal fluid) between **vesicles**
            - **2 lateral ventricles:** in each cerebral hemisphere (derived from telencephalic vesicles)
            - **1 third ventricle:** in the thalamus (derived from the diencephalon)
            - **1 fourth ventricle:** in the pons and cerebellum (derived from the metencephalon)
                - connected to the third ventrical via the **cerebral aqueduct** (in the midbrain (derived from the mesencephalon)), and connects to the spine
        - **clinical disorders:**
            - failure of neural tube closure = spina bifida
            - failure of cranial development = anencephaly
            - complete failure = rachischisis
    - **cns has neural patterning:** along cranio-caudal and dorso-ventral axes
        - **cranio-cadual axis:**
            - **cranially:** width expands and forms flexures due to space-constraints 
                - proliferation of neuroblasts and glioblasts form neurons and glia of the brain
            - **caudally:** width remains constant (spinal cord) except for cervical and lumbar enlargements (due to more nerves to supply upper and lower limbs respectively)
                - proliferation of cells from **ependymal (ventricular)** layer builds layers going from the surface of the lumen outward **(going outward: ependymal → mantle → marginal layer)**
                    - **ependymal** layer lines central canal
                    - **mantle** layer forms **gray matter** of spinal cord (mainly nerve cell bodies)
                    - **marginal** layer forms **white matter** of spinal cord (mainly neuronal processes)
                    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/7tfflj3.png =350x)
        - **dorsal-ventral axis:**
            - **ventrally:** motor neurons
                - **basal plates** produce voluntary **(somatic)** motor neurons 
                - this happens when surface ectoderm and roof plate produce **bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPS) and Wnts** that induce sensory neuron formation and inhibit motor neuron formation
            - **dorsally:** sensory neurons
                - **alar plates** produce sensory **(somatic)** pathways
                - this happens when notochord and floor plate produce **transcription factor Shh (sonic hedgehog)** that induces motor neuron formation and inhibits sensory neuron formation
            - ![](https://i.imgur.com/5wcf2Qu.png =350x)
            - **sulcus limitans** between **basal** and **alar plates** produces motor and sensory neurons of the **visceral (autonomic)** pathways
- **embryonic folding:**
    - **how embryonic folding occurs:**
        - embryonic folding occurs in **2 planes:**
            - **transverse/lateral embryonic folding:**
                - **somites** expand, causing **amniotic sac** to pull downwards
                - **amniotic sac** pulls down while **yolk sac** becomes narrow and small, until **amniotic sac** loops around other side and pinches off most of **yolk sac**
                - ![](https://i.imgur.com/eNQQHUW.png =350x)
                - what remains is the **embryo**, the remains of the **yolk sac** ends up forming the **gut** (lined by **splanchnic/visceral mesoderm**) and is surrounded by the **embryonic body cavity** that forms **cavities in the thorax and abdomen** (lined by **somatic/parietal mesoderm**)
            - **longitudinal embryonic folding:**
                - **cranial** and **caudal** ends of **amniotic sac** fold inward by proliferation of the **neural tube** pushing structures inward 
                - ![](https://i.imgur.com/1xQJn1a.png =350x)
                - primitive gut formed by a combination of **transverse/lateral** and **longitudinal folding** bringing in the **endoderm**
                    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/PAjbUiD.png =350x)
                        - **foregut** and **hindgut** form
                            - **allantois** in **hindgut** collects waste and performs gas exchange (early embryogenesis), and passes waste to mother via placenta and becomes part of umbillical cord (late embryogenesis)
                        - **cardiac** region pushed inward
                    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/qA2zFEU.png =350x)
                        - **foregut** and **hindgut** get closer as **midgut** opening to **yolk sac** narrows until it becomes a **yolk stalk** and then a **vitelline duct**
                        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/b3nmkck.png =450x)
                            - foregut, midgut, and hindgut grouped based on arterial supply
    - **outcome of faulty folding:**
        - respiratory system defects:
            - oesophaegeal atresia (OA) and trachea-oesophageal fistula (TOF) result from abnormal separation of trachea from oesophagus
                - OA: when oesophagus doesn't fully develop (has a dead end)
                - TOF: when trachea and oesophagus don't fully separate
        - ventral body wall defects:
            - intestine temporarily develops in the umbilical cord during development, but if a small part remains, a baby is born with an umbilical hernia
                - if a large part remains, a baby is born with omphalocoele
            - if lateral folding and fusion fails, the bowel might herniate in later embryogenesis, so a baby is born with gastroschisis
        - vitelline duct defects:
            - persistence of the vitelline duct can cause defects: e.g. meckel's diverticulum (outpocket of ileum)
                - attachments can twist (volvulus) and cause stenosis and ischaemia
        - recto-anal defects:
            - ![](https://i.imgur.com/zmXEl6S.png =450x)
