> learning objectives: know that gastrulation is the process to form three germ layers, understand how these three germ layers are formed by cell migration, know basic derivatives of the three germ layers, know how somites arise and their main divisions, understand why we have segmental innervation of skin and muscles

## Pre-gastrulation: week 2
- 2nd week spent growing and forming important cavities (week of '2s')
- **2 layers, trophoblast:** cytotrophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast
- **bilaminar disc:** epiblast, hypoblast
- **2 layers of extraembryonic mesoderm** (somatic, splanchnic) appear between cytotrophoblast and yolk sac
- **2 cavities:** amniotic, yolk sac

## Embryonic disc is basic field for embryo formation

### Gastrulation
- process whereby bilaminar disc undergoes reorganizaation to form a trilaminar disc
![](https://i.imgur.com/7nHRuB8.png =250x)
- process of making **three germ layers** (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm (displaces the hypoblast)) by future mesodermal cells migrating out **epiblast** layer
- commences in **week 3**
- **axial orientation established**

- epiblast cells move towards central axis (primitive streak, later) and delaminate when they pass through it

## Gastrulation steps
- **begins with formation of primitive streak on epiblast surface**
- appears caudally, median plane (proliferation and movement of epiblast cells)
- elongates towards cranial and caudal ends; cranial end forms thickening **(primitive node)**
- primitive streak determines cranio-caudal axis, left and right sides
- primitive **groove** and **pit** formed by invagination (inward movement) of epiblast cells
![](https://i.imgur.com/2ObxmBR.png =250x)
- after primitive streak appears, cells leave epiblast (delaminate) and migrate to form both **mesoderm** and **endoderm** (which **displaces** hypoblast cells)\
![](https://i.imgur.com/BuIaTYe.png =350x)
- cells that did not delaminate from the epiblast remain as **ectoderm**
- migrating mesenchymal cells distribute widely to form connective tissue cells
- **this is hwo the three germ layers are formed**

### Fate of primitive streak
- forms mesoderm by ingression of cells until early fourth week
- thereafter, mesoderm production slows
- streak diminishes in size and siappears by end of fourth week

### Formation of notochord
- mesodermal cells migrating cranially from primitive node and pit form a cellular cord: the **notochordal process**
- acquires a lumen: **notochordal canal**
- grows cranially to **prechordal plate** (later **oropharyngeal membrane**)
- also extends caudally towards **cloacal membrane** as primitive streak regresses

#### Endoderm and ectoderm are fused at oropharyngeal membrane and cloacal membrane
- **oropharyngeal membrane:** later oral cavity
- **cloacal membrane:** later anus

### Formation of notochord
- hollow notochordal process transforms into solid **notochord** between day 16-22
- ntoochordal process fuses with endoderm forming temporary **notochordal plate**
- beginning at cranial end, notochordal plate infolds to form solid notochord, detaches from endoderm

#### Function and fate of notochord
- defines intiial longitudinal axis of embryo, gives some rigidity
- provides signals necessary for development of msuculoskeletal structures and central nervous system 
- degenerates as vertebral bodies form but contributes to formation of intervertebral discs (nucleus pulposus)

### Mesoderm: segmented and unsegmented
- during notochordal and neural tube formation, changes take place in embryonic **mesoderm**
- early mesoderm becomes organised in 3 regions:
    - **paraxial** mesoderm: somites or segmental mesoderm near midline
    - **intermediate** cell mass (segmented): mesonephros
    - **lateral plate** mesoderm (unsegmented): splits into **somatic** and **splanchnic** layer
- **lateral plate mesoderm now continuous with extraembryonic mesoderm covering umbilical vesicle and amnion**
    - intermediate and lateral plate mesoderm only form in trunk region

### Somites
- the surface of extoderm has been removed
- the closed neural tube (later) lies in the midline between **pairs of somites**
- caudal to last pair is the as yet unsegmented paraxial mesoderm

#### Appearance of somites
- somties appear in a cranial to caudal sequence
- they develop from a mesodermal region called the segmental plate
- before the somties are formed, a segmented pattern can be seen in the segmental plate: the **somitomeres**
- by end of week 5 - 42-44, pairs of somites line neural tube
- lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) starts to differentiate into **somatic** and **splanchnic** areas (continuous with extraembryonic mesoderm)
    - the somatic will become the body wall and limbs
    - the splanchnic will become the viscera (organs)
    - remember: these two layers of LPM have a space between them which is important as it eventually forms body cavities (later lecture)
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/Dgck6PI.png =450x)
- in later stage embryos, the splanchnic mesoderm can be seen surrounding the primitive gut and the somatic mesoderm closely associated with the body wall
- paraxial mesoderm still on either side of neural tube, while another are of mesoderm, the intermediate, is between the paraxial and LPM layers
- the intermediate mesoderm will go on to form the **urogenital system**

#### Divisions of somites
- splanchnic
- primitive gut
- somatic
- intermediate
- paraxial

### Subdivisions of somites
- each somite can be subdivided into:
    1. a surface crescent: the **dermatome**
    2. an intermediate crescent: the **myotome**
    3. a medio-ventral wedge: the **sclerotome**

#### Developmental fates of somites
- **dermatome:** dermis in body wall and limbs
- **myotome:** myoblasts which migrate away from central axis and form skeletal muscle of body wall and limbs
- **sclerotome:** vertebrae, ribs and sternum, and portions of occipital bone of skull

#### Dermatomes
- a localized area of skin that receives innervation via a single nerve from a signle nerve root of the spinal cord
- spinal cord branches off into individual nerve roots that pass through openings between the vertebra
- each nerve root receives sensory singals from a sepcfici area of the body called a dermatome

#### Myotomes
- blocks of muscle cells
- some migrate distally into body walls 
- some migrate into areas of future upper and lower limbs

#### Sclerotomes
- become vertebrae
- it is therefore important that in the midline these cells surround the notochord, as the notochord remnants in the neonate and adult form elements of intervertebral discs

##### Further development of sclerotomes
- there is one spinal nerve corresponding to each somite
- each grows through the cranial part of its sclerotome dividing it into 2, then innervates the myotome and dermatome derivatives of that somite
- each vertebra is formed by the coalescence of the caudal and cranial parts of adjacent sclerotomes
- this ensures that msucle have attachments to adjacent vertebrae

##### Development of vertebral column
- occipital somites 1,2,3 and 4 and the cranial part of cervical sclerotome 1 form the occipital bone
- thus cervical spine nerve 1-7 run above C1-7
- T1 and lower nerves run from **below** the corresponding vertebral body
