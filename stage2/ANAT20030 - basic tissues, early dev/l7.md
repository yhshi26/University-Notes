> learning objectives: explain breast development, differentiate and locate breast components, relate breast structure and function, describe lymphatic drainage, assess clinical implications

## Breast position
- anterior chest wall
- boundary extends:
    - **vertically** between **ribs 2-6** along midclavicular line
    - **transversely** from **lateral border of sternum to midaxillary line**
    - **toward axillary fossa** as an extension of mammary gland: **axillary process/tail**

### Retromammary space (submammary space)
- breast lies over a muscular base:
    - 2/3 pectoralis major
    - 1/3 serratus anterior
- **retromammary space:** separates muscles from breast
    - loose connective tissue
    - allows some movement of breast
    - contains lymphatics and small vessels
- **clinical:** advanced mammary carcinoma may cause tethering of breast to the underlying musculature
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/J7GDsCq.png =250x)
    
### Cooper's ligaments
- each mammary gland is firmly attached to overlying skin of the breast **via Cooper's ligaments** (suspensory)
    - extend from deep fascia to dermis around nipple
    - well developed in the upper part of the breast
    - support breast tissue maintain its non-ptotic form
- **clinical:** changes in breast appearance
    - skin dimpling: peau d'orange
        - because breast skin is tethered by Cooper's ligaments, accumulation of fluid may cause the skin to have a dimpled appearance 

## Breast changes and imaging
- **vessels**
    - may calcify with age
- **parenchyma**
    - ducts may contain secretions and calcification
- **fat and connective tissue**
    - thicken in response to tumour, contribute to mass

### Breast quadrants and occurence of malignancy
- **5 areas: 4 quadrants + central**
- superior lateral quadrant
    - includes axillary tail/process
    - **most common location for malignant tumours**
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/EYtTLUC.png =200x)

### Lymphatics
- the lymphatic flow of the breast is of great clinical significance because metastatic dissemination occurs principally by the lymphatic routes
- **lymph drains from nipple to areola to mammary glands to a lymphatic plexus**
    - **75%** drains to **axillary nodes** (mainly superior-lateral quadrant):
        - pectoral
        - subscapular
        - humeral
        - central
        - apical
    - majority of remaining drains medially to **parasternal nodes** or opposite breast
    - some also drains to **abdominal, deep cervical and supraclavicular** nodes

#### Axillary lymph node location
- **pectoralis minor as landmark of lymph node location**
    1. **level I:** below lower edge pec minor
    2. **level II:** deep to pec minor
    3. **level III:** above/medial to pec minor

#### Breast cancer: causes for concern
![](https://i.imgur.com/bF6nrLz.jpg =350x)

#### Lymphatic drainage issues
Interference with lymphatic drainage by cancer may cause:
1. **axillary venous thrombosis**: obstruction of blood passage, life threatening
2. **lymphoedema**: impaired lymph flow from upper limb to axilla
    - excess fluid in subcutaneous tissues
    - visual changes in breast (a clue to breast cancer)
    - treatment:
        - sleeve
        - bandage
        - exercise
        - massage
        - laser therapy

## Breast histology
> learning objectives: recognize different structures of mammary glands in histological images, relate structures to function, describe mammary gland changes during pregnancy, differentiate between active and inactive mammary glands, explain the process of lactation and composition of the product

### Breasts
- **female breast** more developed than male breast
- specialized organ
- **primary function**: produce milk for nutrition of the infant and baby through **mammary gland**

#### Components
- **adipose tissue (90%)**: fibrous supporting tissue
- **glandular tissues (mammary glands)**:
    - compound tubuloalveolar
    - part of reproductive system
    - responds to hormonal stimuli for feeding babies
    - 15-25 lobes with lobules - alveoli
- **lactiferous ducts** each 2-4.5cm long
- **vacsular components, nerves, lymphatic drainage**
- **connective tissue**: suspensory ligaments = Cooper's ligament
![](https://i.imgur.com/zvlPoIZ.png =300x)

#### Mammary glands
- **modified apocrine sweat gland**
    - no capsule or sheath
    - develop from ectodermal inversion
- **located in subcutaneous tissue overlying pectoralis muscles**
    - **females**: part of reproductive system
    - **males**: functionless (fewer ducts and glandular system not developed)
- **develop along milk lines**
![](https://i.imgur.com/n6PRmUv.png =200x)

#### Mammary gland histology
![](https://i.imgur.com/BCquw1m.jpg =400x)

#### Lobes
- each breast contains 15-20 **lobes** of separated **septae** of connective tissue with **adipose cells**

##### Lactiferous duct
- each lobe is drained by a single **lactiferous duct** that opens into the nipple
- it is lined by a **double layer of cuboidal or columnar cells** surrounded by a sheath of connective tissue with myoid cells
![](https://i.imgur.com/hxCxQ3L.png =150x)

##### Intralobular ducts
- lined by one or **two layers** of **cuboidal cells** surrounded by a thin layer of connective tissue
![](https://i.imgur.com/9TauqHQ.png =150x)

##### Terminal ductules
- branches of intralobular ducts
- lined with cuboidal secretory cells
- during pregnancy, they differentiate into secretory alveoli that produce milk
![](https://i.imgur.com/OKLAmAQ.png =150x)

##### Alveoli (acini)
- **simple** epithelium **cuboidal or columnar** secretory cells that **synthesize and secrete milk**
- grow and expand during pregnancy and lactation
- milk: the eosinophilic material with the alveolar lumen and ducts is protein from secreted milk
![](https://i.imgur.com/UI0wC0W.png =150x)

#### Review: glands structural classification
![](https://i.imgur.com/qcjhnBq.png =300x)

### Mammary development
- week 4 embryo (A): **mammary crests** = 2 bands of thickened ectoderm → **milk lines**
![](https://i.imgur.com/WC9Qyty.png =300x)
- invagination (folding inside) of the mammary bud occurs by day 49 and the remaining mammary line involutes
- these ectodermal ingrowths branch into 15-20 solid buds that will becomes the ducts and lobes of alveoli in the fully formed gland
- surrounding mesenchyme forms the connective tissue, fat and vasculature that is invaded by the mammary nerves

#### Milk lines
- **ridges of mammary crest disappear**
- when normal regression fails:
    - **polymastia** = accessory breasts
    - **polythelia** = accessory nipples
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/C7ueisq.png =100x)
    
#### Mammary development: puberty in females
- increase in fat (primarily), areola and nipple size, glandular tissue
- **regulated by hormones:**
    - **estrogen:** increases number of ducts, pigmentation of areola
    - **progesterone:** stimulates development of alveoli and lobules
- **tanner stages of puberty, breast development females:**
![](https://i.imgur.com/FSRB9sM.png =300x)

#### Mammary development: pregnancy
- **growth of mammary glands**
- driven by hormones
    - estrogen
    - progesteron
    - prolactin
    - lactogen
- **cell proliferation in secretory alveoli**
![](https://i.imgur.com/b7gUGjU.png =200x)

##### Inactive mammary gland
- **inactive = non-lactating**
- **more stroma (connective tissue) than glandular tissue**
![](https://i.imgur.com/pVjebmV.png =250x)

##### Mammary glands undero dramatic proliferation and development during pregnancy
- **first trimester**
    - epithelial and myoepithelial cells proliferate
- **second trimester**
    - increased mass of breast due to cell proliferation
    - cells vary in shape from flattened to low columnar
    - plasma cells, lymphocytes, and eosinophils infiltrate the stroma
- **third trimester**
    - epithelial glandular cells become cuboidal
    - cell proliferation declines
    - increase in breask mass due to hypertrophy and accumulation of secretions in the alveoli

##### Lactation
- milk production in alveoli of mammary glands
- stimulated primarily by prolactin from anterior pituitary
- **breakdown:**
    - protein, large amounts: merocrine secretion, 1g/dL
    - lipid droplets: apocrine secretion, 5g/dL
    - lactose: carbohydrate, 7g/dL

##### Active mammary gland
- **active = lactating**
- glands with secretory alveoli well developed
- alveoli simple monolayer 
- ducts remain 2 layer
- little stroma, no fat cells
![](https://i.imgur.com/MY30EFh.png =250x)

### Milk production involves both merocrine and apocrine secretion
- **protein: merocrine secretion**
    - mostly **casein** (amino acid), **44%**, β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin
    - lactose (carbohydrate)
- **fat (lipid droplets): apocrine secretion**
    - **colustrum** = yellowish secretion released in first few days after child birth **(=premilk)**
    - higher on protein, vitamin A, sodium, chloride
    - lower on lipid, carbohydrate, and potassium than milk
    - immunoglobulin A antibodies from plasma cell → infant immunity

#### Summary: areolar development and pregnancy
![](https://i.imgur.com/T3V33eD.png =450x)

### Nipple-areolar complex
![](https://i.imgur.com/jjfokx0.png =200x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/TRu3d6S.png =400x)

#### Nipple (mammary papilla)
- opening of **15-25 lactiferous ducts** (each arising from a lobule)
- each opening: 0.5mm diameter
- central raised bud = **mammary papilla**
- circularly arranged smooth muscles
    - smooth muscle to compress ducts and erect nipple
- inversion/retraction may be congenital or pathological
![](https://i.imgur.com/0O2Q386.png =250x)

#### Areola
- circular pigmented area (more melanin in skin)
    - pigmentation varies
    - becomes stronger in puberty
- contains:
    - sebaceous glands for lubrication
    - abundant sensory nerves: free endings, Meissner copuscles and Merkel discs

#### Montgomery's tubercles (4-28 per nipple)
- intermediate between sweat and mammary glands
- produce small elevations on areola surface
- produce lubricating and protective secretions believed to change skin pH to impede microbial growth
