learning objectives: classify neurons, discuss different components of neurons, classify support cells and delineate their functions, discuss neurotransmission and define and classify synapses

## Anatomical basis of nervous system
- **neuron**
    - basic **functional unit**
    - receives and integrates incoming information: transmits this information to other neurons or **effector organs**

## Divisons of nervous system
### Central nervous system (CNS)**
- rain, spinal cord (most nerve cell bodies, connections)

### Peripheral nervous system (PNS):
- link between CNS and **peripheral** structures (e.g. skin, receptors, muscles)
- **cranial** nerves, **spinal** nerves and their branches
- **autonomic nervous system**

## Components of nervous system
1. **neurons (carry impulses)**
    - billions in nervous system
    - very little connective tissue
    - supported in structure and function by **glial cells**
    - each has hundreds of interonnections with other neurons, forming a complex processing system
2. **glia (support cells)**
    - CNS:
        - strocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, ependymal cells
    - PNS:
        - satellite cells, schwann cells
    - support and protect neurons
    - participate in neural activity, neural nutrition and defense of cells in CNS

### Neurons
- consist of 3 main parts:
    - **cell body** (synthetic centre for entire cell, receptive to stimuli)
    - **dendrites:** elongated processes; specialised to **receive** stimuli from the environment or other neurons
    - **axon:** single process specialised in generating/conducting nerve impulses to **other** cells (nerve, muscle and gland cells)

#### Classification of neurons (A)
- neurons and their processes are variable in size and shape
- neurons can be classified by:
    - number of processes (A) extending from cell body:
        - **multipolar** neurons
            - one axon
            - two (or more) dendrites
            - most neurons are multipolar
            - used for motor and sensory processing
            - e.g. purkinje cells in cerebellar cortex
            - ![](https://i.imgur.com/aa9HbcW.png =250x)
        - **bipolar** neurons
            - one axon emerging
            - one dendrite entering
            - used for special sensory neurons
                - vision, small, balance
            - ![](https://i.imgur.com/uTMBgYN.png =250x)
        - **pseudounipolar** neurons
            - have single process that bifurcates (splits) close to cell body
            - longer branch extends towards peripheral structures, shorter towards CNS
            - found in spinal ganglia (sensory ganglia of spinal nerves)
            - ![](https://i.imgur.com/stX3aDo.png =250x)

#### Further classification of neurons (B)
- **afferent:** carry information from peripheral receptors **to** CNS (**sensory** if information reaches conscious level)
- **efferent:** carry impulses **away from** CNS (**motor** if they reach muscle)
- **interneurons:** vast majority; 'relay' neurons **within** CNS

#### Further classification of neurons (C)
- according to structure
    - **myelinated:**
        - myelin = protein which acts as insulator
        - helps conduction of action potential (impulse)
        - myelin is produced by **schwann cells** (PNS) or **oligodendrocytes** (CNS)
        - openings between schwann cells on peripheral nerves called nodes of ranvier
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/kl2wtGq.png =150x)
    - **unmyelinated**

### Support cells
- CNS
    - glial cells
- PNS
    - schwann cells
    - PNS glial cells (satellite cells)

### CNS support cells 
#### Glial cells
- much more numerous than neurons (neurons only make up 10% total cells)
- glial cells proliferate (unlike neurons)
- provide metabolic support, insulation, protection, reinforcement, repair; also clean up damaged areas
- types:
    - astrocytes
    - oligodendrocytes
    - ependymal cells
    - microglia

#### Astrocytes
- star-shaped
- large
- hold neurons together
- contact with vessels (via end-feet)
- prevent certain chemicals from leaving blood and damaging neurons **(blood brain barrier)**

#### Oligodendrocytes
- form myelin in **CNS**
    - improve electrical conduction
    - provides nourishment for axon
    - processes wrap around several axon
- many needed to cover entire length of axon

#### Ependymal cells
- line ventricles of brain
- act as barrier to prevent cerebrospinal fluid leaking rfom ventricles into brain tissue

#### Microglia
- irregularly shaped
- small
- mobile
- phagocytic: scan tissue for damaged cells and invading microorganisms
- major mechanism of immune defense

### PNS support cells
#### Schwann cells
- only found in PNS
- one schwann cell forms myelin around a segment of **one axon**
- series of schwann cells covers full length of axon
![](https://i.imgur.com/2DT4pEt.png =150x)

#### Satellite cells
- form covering layer over large neuronal cell bodies in PNS ganglia
- exert a supportive role

### Grey matter vs. white matter
- **grey matter:** enriched in nerve **cell bodies** (surface of cerebral hemisphere [good blood supply], central portion of spinal cord)
- **white matter:** mostly never **processes** (axons), **myelin**ated fibres give paler colour

## Neuronal signalling
- synapse: junction between two neurons, or between neuron and muscle

### Synapse classification
- axoaxonic: axon to axon
- axodendritic: axon to dendrite
- axosomatic: axon to cell body
- dendrodendritic: dendrite to dendrite
- neuromuscular: axon to muscle fibre
