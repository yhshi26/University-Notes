> learning objectives: understand structural basis of face, palate and pharyngeal arches; know derivatives of pharyngeal arches; be aware of clinical implications of defects in palate and pharyngeal arch development

## Development of face
### Facial prominences
- during 4th-10th weeks of development, face forms five prominences (swellings) that grow and fuse together
    - 1 **frontonasal** prominence
    - 2 **maxillary** prominences
    - 2 **mandibular** prominences
- the frontonasal prominence forms from neural crest cells migrating from the midbrain
- the maxillary and mandibular prominences, derived from pharyngeal arch 1, form around the **stomodeum** (primordial mouth)

![](https://i.imgur.com/oCFXrIS.png =250x)
- the nasal plit extends caudally, subdividing the nasal placode into a **nasomedial process** and **nasolateral process** (new prominences)
- the groove between the maxillary prominence and the nasolateral process is called the **nasolacrimal groove**
- the mandibular process begins to fuse
![](https://i.imgur.com/oFzFTPK.png =400x)
- the two **nasomedial processes** fuse to form the **intermaxillary segment**
- the **intermaxillary segment** and the **maxillary processes** fuse, forming the upper lip and jaw architecture **(philtrum)**

### If fusion does not occur
- **oblique facial cleft:**
    - **nasolateral prominence** and **maxillary prominence** fail to fuse
    - result in nasolacrimal ducts becoming open grooves
    - extremely rare
- **median cleft lip:**
    - nasomedial processes fail to fuse into a signle intermaxillary segment
    - very rare
- **cleft lip:**
    - failure of **intermaxillary segment** and **maxillary prominence** to fuse 
    - sometimes associated with cleft palate (CP)
    - 1 per 1000 (+/1 CP)
    - much more common in males (2:1)
    - may be **unilateral** (one side only) or **bilateral**
    - can range from slight indentation in lip to groove extending from lip to nostril
    - risk factors:
        - smoking and binge drinking during pregnancy → increase cleft lip
        - dilantin (anti-epileptic drug): 10-fold increase in cleft lip
- **cleft chin:**
    - likely failure of **mandibular prominences** to fully fuse at midline

### Development of the palate
- the palate is formed from a **primary palate** and a **secondary palate**
- **intermaxillary prominence →** premaxillary shelf (primary palate)
- **maxillary prominences →** palatine shelves (secondary palate)
- **incisive foramen** represents boundary between primary and secondary palates
![](https://i.imgur.com/JrGcEZb.png =350x)
- palate formation separates the **nasal/nasopharyngeal cavities** from the **oral/oropharyngeal** cavities
- the **nasal septum** grows caudally, to fuse at the midline with the palates: separates the nasal cavities into left and right

#### If fusion does not occur
- **bifid uvula:**
    - failure of the palantine shelves to fuse at their **posterior margin**
- **cleft palate:**
    - failure of palantine shelves (**secondary** palate) to fuse 
    - 1 in 1,500 births
    - isolated cleft palate much more common in females (2:1)
    - presents as bifid uvula, partial cleft/separation along the palate wall, or even absent secondary palate
    - sometimes associated with cleft lip

### Development of the face
- by week 8, the nose attains more human-like shape and philtrum is formed
- the maxillary prominences grow rapidly and become larges than the respective mandibular prominences

## Development of the pharyngeal (branchial) arches
### Pharyngeal arches
- 5* pharygeal arches appear on each side of foregut
    - (* only 4 easily visible arches; arch 5 regresses/fails to form; arch 6 not easily visible)
- appear and transform seriallys (superior to inferior)
    - useful indicators of embryonic age (weeks 4-7)
- have a complex structure
    - endodermal/mesodermal/ectodermal and neural crest cells
    - cardiovascular and nervous connections

### Pharyngeal arch structure
- in between arches are extodermal **clefts** and endodermal **pouches** (together: **pharyngeal membrane**)
- each arch contains a nerve, an artery and a bar of cartilage
- each one also gives rise to a group of special visceral msucles which is innervated by the nerve of the arch
![](https://i.imgur.com/a6JH66x.png =250x)
- parts:
    - pharyngeal arch
    - pharyngeal groove/cleft (outside/ectoderm)
    - pharyngeal pouch (inside/endoderm)

#### Cranial neural crest cell migration
- neural crest cells and mesoderm together consitute the pharyngeal **mesenchyme** (embryonic connective tissue)

#### Pharyngeal arch derivatives

#### Nerves
- cranial nerves provide motor innervation for muscles within their specific arch
- three pharyngeal arch nerves have branches that leave their specific arch and provide sensory (and some parasympathetic) innervation to the territory immediately preceding their arches (**pretrematic** nerves)
    - trigeminal → **opthalmic** (face)
    - facial → **chorda tympani** (anterior tongue)
    - glossopharyngeal → **tympanic** (ear, parotid gland)

#### Muscles

#### Bones and cartilages

#### Micrognathia (mandibular hypoplasia)
- **treacher collins syndrom (mandibulofacial dysostosis):**
    - mutation in TCOF1 (treacle) gene, NCC differentiation
    - underdevelopment of mandible and zygomatic bones
- **pierre robin sequence:**
    - consequence of underdeveloped mandible
    - genetic or environmental (oligohydramnios)
    - results in glossoptosis (retracted tongue) and cleft palate
- **digeorge syndrome:**
    - 22q11.1 deletion syndrome: affect NCC migration
    - facial dysmorphology, palatal abnormalities, heart and thymus defects

## Pharyngeal pouches
- **pharyngeal pouch derivatives:**
    - palatine tonsils (2nd)
    - inferior parathyroid gland (3rd)
    - thymus gland (3rd)
    - superior parathyroid gland (4th)
    - ultimopharyngeal body (4th)

#### 1st pharyngeal pouch
- **tubotympanic recess →** later differentiates into the **tympanic cavity fo the middle ear** and the **pharyngotympanic (auditory or eustachian) tube,** connecting the middle each to the pharynx
![](https://i.imgur.com/qarM2G0.png =350x)

#### 2nd pharyngeal pouch
- **endodermal lining** of pouch proliferates and invades mesenchyme of membrane
- emsoderm invades, forming primitive **palantine tonsils**
- tonsil infiltrated by mesodermal **lymphatic tissue** (3-5 months)
- pouch remains as the **tonsillar fossa**

#### 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches
- the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches are each split into **2 distinct portions**
- endodermal linings of the 2rd and 4th pouches proliferate and later separate from pharyngeal wall and migrate
- 3rd pouch:
    - **inferior parathyroids**
    - **thymus**
- 4th pouch:
    - **superior parathyroids**
    - **ultimopharyngeal body** (contributes to thyroid gland)

## Pharyngeal gland migration
![](https://i.imgur.com/wal2VWr.png =350x)

### Undescended and ectopic glands
- gland tissue can fail to migrate, or leave a component behind along the way
    - superior and inferior parathyroid glands
    - thymus glands

### Thyroid gland
- thyroid diverticulum forms from foregut
- developing gland descends from **foramen caecum** of tongue
- passage **(thyroglossal duct)** may remain and form a cyst **(thydroglossal cyst)**
- gland may not migrate **(ectopic thyroid, e.g. lingual thyroid)**

## Neck development
- 2nd pharyngeal arch expands caudally, covering the 3rd-6th arches
- creates a transiet **(lateral) cervical sinus**
- failure of 2nd arch overgrowth leaves opening → **external branchial fistula**
- breakdown of endodermal lining → **internal branchial fistula**
- fluid collection → **lateral branchial cysts**
