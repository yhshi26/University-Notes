## Composition of blood
- **5 litres** of bood in a 70kg person
    - approx 7% of body's weight
- blood composed of 55% liquid **plasma** and 38-45% **cells**
    - **plasma** is 90% **water** by volume, but also contains:
        - 7% **protein** (54% albumins, 38% globulins, 7% fibrinogen, 1% other assotred proteins like hormones)
        - 1.5% **other things**
            - glucose 
            - mineral ions
            - carbon dioxide (plama being the main medium for excretory product transportation)
- blood stats:
    - slightly alkaline (pH = 7.40 ± 0.5)
    - density of 1.057 ± 0.009g/ml

### Centrifuging blood to separate components
- plasma (55%):
    - water
    - gases
    - ions
    - proteins
    - lipids
    - carbohydrates
- cells (45%):
    - erythrocytes (rbcs)
    - leucocytes (wbcs)
    - platelets (cell fragments)

### Plasma and serum
- blood minus cells = plasma
- plasma minus clotting factors (plus factors from activated platelets) = serum

## Cell types

### Anucleated
#### Erythrocytes (RBCs)
- flattened, biconcave discs
    - no nucleus or organelles
        - age and lose flexibility
        - life-span 120 days
    - large surface area for oxygen diffusion
- packed with haemoglobin
    - formed in nucleated precursor cells during maturation of rbc
    - oxyhaemoglobin: oxygen transport
    - carbaminohaemoglobin: carbon dioxide transport

##### Reticulocytes
- constitute 1% of normal rbc count
    - young rbcs, recently released from bone marrow
        - bluish tinge in cytoplasm due to residual rna
    - mature in 48 hours
        - lose rna and bluish tinge

#### Platelets (thrombocytes)
- small disc
    - anuclear (fragments)
- peripheral hyalomere (glassy)
- central granulomere (alpha and delta granules)
- originate from megakaryocytes in bone marrow
- essential in haemostasis: promote clotting and plug gaps in endothelium

##### Structure and function
- contractile and adhesive
    - microtubules facilitate platelet movement and migration
    - glycoprotein rich cell coat which plays major role in cell adhesion
- sparse mitochondria and glycogen
- intracellular granules and dense bodies: released on stimulation
- **alpha granules** contains protein and peptides
    - von willebrand factor
    - some clotting factors
    - growth factors
- these are delivered to the site of vascular injury to contribute to:
    - clot formation
    - healing and repair
- **dense bodies** (less abundant):
    - rich in calcium
    - serotonin
    - with ADP, ATP
    - cofactors help localize clotting at sites of injury/activation

### Nucleated
#### Leucocytes (WBCs)
- primary roles: protection against infection, repair
- 2 categories:
    - **agranulocytes (mononuclear):**
        - lymphocytes, monocytes
    - **granulocytes (polymorphonuclear):**
        - lifespan few days
        - neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils

##### Neutrophils (microphages)
- motile
- phagocytic
- 1-4 day lifespan
- 12-15 micrometers
- **multi-lobed** nucleus
- cytoplasmic granules
- major function:
    - rapid response
        - defence against infection
        - response to damage
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/keN1aCq.png =150x)

###### Neutrophil specific granules
- primary (less numerous):
    - azurophilic, acid hydrolases, lysozyme, defensins, myeloperoxidase, **digest** bacteria with enzymes
- secondary (most numerous):
    - very small granules, contents **secreted out** of neutrophil into extracellular environment, degrade ECM, inflammatory mediators, complement activators

##### Eosinophils 
- bilobed nucleus
- eosinophilic (red) granules 
    - major basic protein
    - kills parasites/worms
- IgE receptors on surface
- functions:
    - parasitic defence
    - modulates inflammation
        - increased numbers in allergic reactions
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/JpI9QMG.png =150x)

##### Basophils
- bilobed nucleus
- basophilic (blue) granules
- major basic protein
- secrete histamine and heparin
- have IgE receptors on surface
- modulate inflammation
- can migrate into tissues: similar to and supportive of tissue mast cells
![](https://i.imgur.com/Dzflylw.png =150x)

##### Lymphocytes
- immunological defence
    - specific immune system vs. bacteria, viruses, etc.
- B lymphocytes
- plasma cells are fully differentited B lymphocytes which produce immunoglobulin
- T lymphocytes
![](https://i.imgur.com/vvsmb8C.png =150x)

##### Monocytes (members of the mononuclear, phagocytic system)
- largest WBC
- motile and phagocytic
- precursors of tissue macrophages
- play important role in:
    - inflammation, healing and repair
    - immunity
- in inflammation and other situations, leave blood to **become macrophages** in tissues

## Haemopoietic cells
![](https://i.imgur.com/GNVsN8d.png =350x)

### Haematopoeisis
- the circulating blood cells are formed in bone marrow through a process called haematopoiesis
- the bone marrow has an enormous production capacity; it is estimated that 10^10^ erythryocytes and 10^8^ to 10^9^ leukocytes are produced per hour in the steady state
    - implications?
- while cell numbers are maintained within fairly narrow limits in normal subjects, they can be greatly amplified on demand

### Sites of haematopoiesis

|          |          | site |
| -------- | -------- | ---- |
| foetus | 0-2 months | yolk sac | 
| | 2-7 months | liver, spleen | 
| |  5-9 months | bone marrow | 
| infants | | bone marrow, practically all bones | 
| adults | | vertebrae, ribs, sternum, skull, sacrum and pelvis, proximal ends of femur | 

- in adults, all blood cells are produced in red marrow
    - red marrow found in bones of axial skeleton: vertebrae, ribs, sternum, skull, sacrum, pelvis and proximal femora of adults
- in infants and children, practically all bones contain haematopoietically active marrow

#### Bone marrow in adults
- medullary canals of long bones
- cavities of cancellous bones
- **two types:**
    - red: haematogenous: active
    - yellow: adipose cells: inactive

#### Bone marrow
- examined in two ways:
    - aspirated, smeared on slide and stained
    - trephine biopsy (core of tissue) using a wide-bore needle
        - further information on structure and cellularity of marrow can be obtained by preparation of sections
- functions:
    - erythropoiesis
    - leukopoiesis
        - granulopoiesis
        - monocytopoiesis
        - lymphopoiesis
    - thrombocytopoiesis

#### Normal bone marrow structure

## Haematopoiesis
- mature blood cells are terminally differentiated with finite life spans
- they must be replenished constantly
- peripheral blood cells: RBCs, granulocytes, monocytes, platelets, and lymphocytes have a common origin from **pluripotent hematopoietic** stem cells
- stem cells not only differentiate, but also **self-renew**, a **critical property of stem cells**
- requires:
    - stem cells
    - environment
    - growth factors
    - co-factors (B vitamins, iron)
- controlled by growth factors (and marrow environment)
    - proliferation
    - differentiation
    - maturation
- factors include:
    - granulocyte: macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and other colony stimulating factors
    - interleukins: WBCs
    - erythropoietin: RBCs
    - thrombopoietin: platelets

### Haematopoiesis steps
![](https://i.imgur.com/cQhtfzw.png =350x)

#### Erythropoiesis
- 7 days for production of an erythrocyte
- erythrocyte life span = 120 days
- requirements:
    - folic acid
    - iron
    - vit B12
    - erythropoietin (colony stimulating factor) (kidney+liver)

#### Myelopoiesis
![](https://i.imgur.com/Mjyd4lU.png =350x)

### Haematopoietic growth factors
- growth factors are important in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells
- act on stromal cells:
    - IL-1, TNF
- act on pluripotent stem cells:
    - **S**tem **C**ell **F**actor (c-Kit ligand), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3l) (binds to CD135)
- act on multipotent progenitor cells:
    - IL-3 (myeloid and mgakaryocytes), IL-7 (lymphoid), GM-CSF, IL-6 (myeloid and lymphoid cells), **G-CSF**
- act on committed progenitor cells
    - **erythropoietin**, thrombopoietin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-% (eosinophil stimulating factor)
- (recombinant growth factors such as erythropoietin and GCSF are used therapeutically)
