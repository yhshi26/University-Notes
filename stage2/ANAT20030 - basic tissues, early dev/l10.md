> learning objectives: list and describe structures of lymph node, thymus and diffuse lymphatic tissues including cell types they contain; describe how lymph is filtered in lymph node; describe T cell development in thymus; recognise microscopic structures in lymph node and thymus; relate these components to function

## Overview of lymphatic system
- **lymphatic system:** consists of groups of cells, tissues, and organ that monitor body surface and internal fluid compartments and react to the presence of potentially harmful substances
- **lymphocytes:** are the definitive cell type of the lymphatic system and the effector cells in the response of the immune system to harmful substances
- **immune system:** the various lymphatic organs, lymphatic tissues and specialized cells
- **lymphatic vessels:** connect parts of the system to the blood vascular system

### Components
- lymph and lymphatic vessels
- thymus, red bone marrow, GALT primary (gut-associated lymphoid tissue)
- spleen, MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue), tonsils, **lymph nodes** (secondary)

### Functions
- produce, maintain and distribute lymphocytes **(primary organs)**
- maintain normal blood volume and chemical composition of interstitial fluid
- alternative route for transportign hormones, nutrients and waste products

### Lymphatic drainage
- function: maintain normal blood volume and chemical composition of interstitial fluid (filter)

## Lymph node
- **lymph nodes:** bean-shaped, encapsulated structures:
    - generally only 10mm by 2.5cm in size,
    - distributed throughout the body along the lymphatic vessels
    - 400-450 lymph nodes
    - axillae (armpits), groin, along the major vessels of the neck, thorax and abdomen, and visceral mesenteries
- **functions:**
    - the nodes constitute a series of in-line filters of lymph that defend against the spread of microorganisms and tumor cells
    - antigen presentation and development of plasma cells secreting antibodies
    - add antibodies to blood

- several **afferent lymphatic vessels** pass the capsule and enter the cortex of a lymph node
- lymph is then filtrated within a network of interconnected **lymphatic sinuses** (subscapular, trabecular, and medullary) and leaves the lymph node by an **efferent lymphatic vessel**
- the **reticular meshwork** of the lymph node contains reticular cells, dendritic cells, follicular dendritic cells, and macrophages; they all interact with T and B cells that are dispersed in the **superficial cortex**, **deep cortex**, and the **medulla** of the lymph node
- lymphocytes from blood vessels enter the lymph node via specialized **high endothelial venules (HEV)** located in the **deep cortex**, which contains most of the **T cells**
- most of the **B cells** are located in the lymph nodules within the **superficial cortex**

### Lymphatic nodules (or follicles)
- a **germinal center** is located in the middle of the lymph nodule
    - contains **large immature lymphocytes**
    - antigen-presenting **follicular dendritic cells**

## Thymus
- the **thymus** is a lymphoepithelial organ located in the superior mediastinum that contains developing **T cells** within an extensive msehwork of interconnected **epithelioreticular cells**
- the thymus is fully formed at birth and persists until puberty
- **function:**
    - **produce differentiate T cells**
    - **development:** involutes in adults 
        - less lymphoid tissue (T cells)
        - replaced by apidose tissue (fat)

### Maturation of T cells

### Thymic cortex
- **thymic cortex:**
    - packed with small, lymphoblasts
    - proliferate
    - undergo selection
- **cytoreticulum:**
    - meshwork that supports lymphoblast
    - consists of unusual thymic epithelial cells
- **epithelial reticular cells (thymic epithelial cells):**
    - antigen-presenting cells
    - extend long cellular processes rather than usual reticular fibers

### Thymic medulla: Hassal corpuscles
- **thymic (Hassal's) corpuscles:**
    - most characteristic microscopic feature of thymic medulla
    - variable size
    - contain aggregates of thymic epithelial cells (epithelioreticular cells)
    - secrete several cytokines that control activity of local dendritic cells, including factors that promote development of regulatory T cells

## Other lymphoid tissues
- tonsils, MALT, BALT

### Tonsils

### Diffuse lymphoid tissue: GALT - Peyer's patch
- **peyer's patches** are very large clusters of lymphoid follicles in the wall of the ileum
- **function: close monitoring of pathogens in the gut**
- diffuse lymphatic tissue and lymphatic nodules are named according to the region in which they appear:
    - **gut-associated lymphatic tissue = GALT**
        - alimentary canal
    - **bronchus-associated lymphatic tissue = BALT**
        - bronchial tree
    - **mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue = MALT**
        - term that includes GALT and BALT
