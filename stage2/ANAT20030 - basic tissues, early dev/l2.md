## Connective tissue
### Structure and function
- provides general structure, mechanical strength, space filling (body shape), and physical and metabolic support
- supports and connects other tissues and organs
    - connective tissue sheet that surrounds muscle cells
    - tendons that attach muscle to bones
    - skeleton that supports the positions of the body
- protection
    - protection of delicate organs through fibrous capsules and bones
    - defense from microorganisms that enter the body through specialized cells within connective tissue
- transport of fluid, nutrients, waste, and chemical messengers
    - through specialized fluid connective tissues, such as blood and lymph
- storage of energy in the form of fat and thermal insulation of the body 
    - through adipose cells

## Cell types in connective tissues
|          | Cell type | Function |
| -------- | --------- | -------- |
|mesenchyme |mesenchymal cells|embryological and fetal cells which form connective tissue|
|fibroblasts |fibroblast|creates and maintains the connective tissue, fibres and matrix|
| |myofibroblast|activated fibroblast specialized for tissue repair with contractile ability; generates repair/healing with scar| 
|adipocytes |white adipose|specialized tissue for storage of triglycerides (fat) as energy reserve but also has metabolic and structural roles|
| |brown adipose|specialized form of adipose tissue most prominent in babies; metabolises triglycerides for heat under the control of the nervous system|
|haematopoietic stem cell-derived|mast cells|tissue resident immune cells involved in immediate hypersensitivity and allergy|
| |tissue macrophages|tissue resident immune cells with prominent phagocytic abilities and major roles in the immune system|
| |lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, plasma cells|other immune cells (usually in transit or in response to inflammation)|

### Fibroblast
- the fibroblast is the principle cell of connective tissue
- fibroblasts are responsible for the synthesis of
    - collagen 
    - elastic and reticular fibers
    - complex carbohydrates of the ground substance
- research suggests that a single fibroblast is capable of producing all the ECM components

### Adipocyte
- the adipocyte is a connective tissue cell specialized to store neutral fat and produce a variety of hormones
- adipocytes differentiate from mesenchymal stem cells and accumulate in their cytoplasm
    - white adipose tissue
        - fat storage, structural fill, thermal insulator, shock absoprtion
    - brown adipose tissue
        - generate heat
- location:
    - loose connective tissue (as individual cells, group of cells)
    - adipose tissue (predominant cell type)
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/57gwnAt.png =250x)

### Macrophage
- macrophages are phagocytic cells that contain an abundant number of lysosomes
- macrophages specialize in: 
    - turnover of protein fibers
    - removal of dead cells, tissue debris, or other particulate material
- derived from blood cells called monocytes
    - monocytes migrate from the bloodstream into the connective tissue, where they differentiate into macrophages
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/1xP5DjW.png =250x)

### Mast cell
- mast cells are ovoid cells with a spherical nucleus and cytoplasm 
- mast cells store secretory products (mediators of inflammation) in granules and release them upon activation, e.g.:
    - heparin: a sulfated GAG, local anticoagulant
    - histamine: promotes increased vascular premeability and smoth muscle contraction
    - serine proteases: activate mediators of inflammation
    - eosinophil and neutrophil chemotactic factors: attrach those leukocytes
    - cytokines: polypeptides directing activities of leukocytes and other immune cells
    - phospholipid precursors: are converted to lipid mediators of the inflammatory response
- mast cells develop in bone marrow and differentiate in connective tissue
- mast cells are especially numerous in the connective tissues of skin and mucous membranes but are not present in the brain and spinal cord

## Fibers
### 3 types of connective tissue fibers:
- connective tissue fibers are elongated structures formed from proteins that polymerize after secretion from fibroblasts
- 3 main types of fibers:
    - collagen fibers
    - reticular fibers
    - elastic fibers
- collagen and reticular fibers are both formed by collagen proteins and elastic fibers are composed of elastin protein
- connective tissue fibers are present in varying amounts depending on the structural needs or function of the connective tissue

### Labelled diagram
![](https://i.imgur.com/MJzM2JS.png =250x)

### Collagen fibers
- most abundant protein in the human body (30% of its dry weight)
- extremely strong an dresistant to normal shearing and tearing forces
- 28 different collagen types:
    - fibrillar collagens (collagen types I, II, and III) form collagen fibers
    - network or sheet-forming collagens (type IV, X) are major structural proteins of external laminae and all epithelial basal laminae
- linking/anchoring collagens (type VII, ...) are short collagens that link fibrillar collagens to one another and to other components of the ECM, link to basal lamina

#### Type I collagen fibers
- most abundant collagen type
- composed of type I fibrils bundled into fibrers
- densely fill connective tissue
- resist tension, extremely strong
- form structures such as tendons, organ capsules, dermis
![](https://i.imgur.com/Ycp4nRU.png =200x)
- ##### tendons:
    - attach skeletal muscle to bone
    - dense regular connective tissue
        - densely packed with bundles of parallel type I collagen, ground substance is sparse
        - fibroblast (tendinocytes) oriented, elongated nuclei
    - provides strength but little stretch
    - poor vascularization
    - heal slowly when damaged
    - thin external sheet of dense CT: epitendineum
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/nNW13Td.png =300x)
    - **clinical:**
        - ruptured achilles tendon
            - partial or complete (strain)
            - healing slow
        - tendonitis
            - overuse of tendons - microtears
            - weakened, increased chance of rupture
- **clinical:**
    - osteogenisis imperfecta (brittle bone disease)
        - congenital deficiency of type I collagen 
        - blue sclera
        - dwarfism

#### Type 2 collagen fibers
- resistant to pressure
- found in cartilage

### Reticular fibers (type 3 collagen fibers)
- reticulin fibers form a delicate supporting framework for many cellular organs such as endocrine glands, lymph nodes, bone marrow and liver
- composed of collagen type III
- reticulin fibers stain poorly in H and E preparations but are able to absorb metallic silver, staining them black
- abundant in lymphoid tissue
![](https://i.imgur.com/4J5EBk9.png =250x)
- **clinical:**
    - elhers-danlos syndrome
        - congenital deficiency of type III and V collagen
        - hyperflexible skin and joints

### Elastic fibers (fibrillin and elastin)
- composed of fibrillin (350 kDa) embedded in cross-linked elastin (60 kDa)
- elastic fibers allow tissues to respond to stretch and distension
- form sparse rubberlike networks and fenestrated sheets
- allow tissue (e.g. lungs, blood vessels) to be stretched and return to their original shape
- stain poorly with H and E, more darkly than collagen with stains such as orcein and dlehyde fuchsin
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/WGxCSkQ.png =200x)

### Ligaments
- connect bone to bone or cartilage
- robust but flexible bands of collagenous tissue
- limit joint motion to appropriate ranges and directions
- similar structure to tendons but 
    - less dense and
    - more elastic fibers

### Ground substance
- ground substance fills the space between cells and fibers, and is very hydrated, viscous and transparent
    - complex mixture of 3 macromolecules
        - glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)
        - proteoglycans 
        - multiadhesive glycoproteins
            - cell adhesion and movement
        - and water (interstitial fluid)
    - allows diffusion of molecules and exchange of metabolites (nutrients, waste)
    - acts as lubricant and barrier to the penetration of invaders
    - barely visible in H and E (white or pale blue)
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/3AIkek6.png =100x)

## Connective tissues
### Loose connective tissue (areolar tissue)
- composition: contains cells, fibers, and ground substane in roughly equal parts
- location: forms a layer beneath the epithelial lining of many organs
- function: fills the spaces between fibers of muscle and nerve
![](https://i.imgur.com/878f50a.png =250x)

### Reticular tissue
- composition: characterized by type III collagen fibers
- secreted by modified fibroblasts (reticular cells) remain associated with and partially cover the fibers
- location: bone marrow, liver, lymph nodes, spleen
- function: forms a delicate network for cells in hemopoietic tissue and lymphoid organs
- only visible using silver stain
![](https://i.imgur.com/e70yuaV.png =200x)

### Dense connective tissue
- dense connective tissue (irregular and regular) features few cells and little ground substance

#### Dense irregular connective tissue
- composition: primarily randomly distributed bundles of type I collagen and some elastic fibers, (function) providing resistance to tearing from all directions and some elasticity
- location: dermis of the skin, organ capsules
![](https://i.imgur.com/e3tIUWJ.png =250x)

#### Dense regular connective tissue
- composition: bundles of essentially parallel type I collagen
- location: prominent in tendons and ligaments
- function: provides strength but little stretch in binding together components of the musculoskeletal system
![](https://i.imgur.com/aXMUpLO.png =250x)

### Elastic connective tissue
- composition: bundles with a central core of elastin associated with a network of fibrillin microfibrils
- location: ligaments of spinal column, ligaments supporting transitional epithelia, blood vessel walls
- function: stabilizes positions of vertebrae and penis, cushions shocks, permits expansion and contraction of organs
> (note: the bundles of elastic fibersare fatter than the collagen fiberbundles of a tendon or typical ligamen)

![](https://i.imgur.com/DOpI4Ns.png =250x)

### Embryonic connective tissue
- **mesenchyme** is primarily found in the embryo (location)
    - function: gives rise to various connective tissues of the body
    - composition: contains a loose network of spindle-shaped cells, viscous ground substance, fine collagen and reticular fibers
    - sparsity of fibers is consistent with the limited physical stess on the growing fetus

### Adipose tissue
- composition: adipocyte cells
- location: deep to skin, especially at sides, buttocks, breasts, padding around eyes and kidneys
- functions: provides padding and cushions shocks, insulates (reduces heat loss), stores energy
![](https://i.imgur.com/gQyrHNt.png =250x)

#### White adipose tissue (unilocular)
- fat storage, structural fill, thermal insulator, shock absorption
![](https://i.imgur.com/etBeIYM.png =200x)

#### Brown adipose tissue (multilocular)
- generate heat, mainly in fetus, brown color, numerous mitochondria
![](https://i.imgur.com/2MXrN4q.png =200x)

## Cartilage

### Cartilage
- tough, durable supporting connective tissue
- high concentration of GAGs and proteoglycans
- bears mechanical stresses without permanent distortion
- **provides low-friction surfaces, structural support and cushioning**
- **guides development and grwoth of long bones**
- no vascularization, no nerves
- **chondrocytes** receive nutrients by diffusion from surrounding connective tissue **(perichondrium)**
- slow healing

### Composition and structure
Cells: chondroblasts, chondrocytes
Fibers: collagen type II
Ground substance: glycosaminoglycans (mostly aggrecan)
Perichondrium:
- sheath of dense connective tissue
- surrounds most cartilage (exception: synovial joints)
- vascular, nerve and lymphatic supply
- essential for growth, maintenance and repair
![](https://i.imgur.com/7qlPEK6.png =250x)

#### Extracellular matrix
![](https://i.imgur.com/pwDigiM.png =200x)

### 3 types of cartilage
![](https://i.imgur.com/ucrVabe.png =750x)
| | Hyaline cartilage | Elastic cartilage | Fibrocartilage |
|-| ----------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
|cells:|chondroblasts and chondrocytes|chondroblasts and chondrocytes|chondrocytes and fibroblasts|
|characteristic features of extracellular matrix:| type II collagen fibrils and aggrecan monomers (most important proteoglycan)|type II collagen fibrils, elastic fibers, and aggrecan monomers|types I and II collagen fibers, proteoglycan monomers; aggrecan (secreted by chondrocytes) and versican (secreed by fibroblasts)|
|functions:|provides smooth, low-friction surfaces in joints; structural support|provides flexible shape and support of soft tissues|provides cushioning, tensile strength, and resistance to tearing and compression|

### Growth of cartilage
- **type 1: appositional growth**
    - the cartilage grows at its external surface through the differentiation of fibroblasts into chondrocytes within the cellular layer of the perichondrium 
![](https://i.imgur.com/jCO0lKA.png =300x)
   
- **type 2: interstitial growth**
    - the cartilage expand from within as chondrocytes in the matrix divide, grow, and produce new matrix
![](https://i.imgur.com/MewkpJI.png =300x)

#### Summary
- all forms of cartilage form from embryonic **mesenchyme**
- cartilaginous structures grow by mitosis of existing chondroblasts in lacunae **(interstitial growth)** or formation of new chondroblasts peripherally from progenitor cells in the perichondrium **(appositional growth)**
- repair or replacement of injured cartilage is very slow and ineffective because of the tissue's lack of blood vessels and **low metabolic rate**
