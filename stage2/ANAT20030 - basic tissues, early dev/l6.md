> learning objectives: delineate different components and layers consituating the integument, recognize different layers of the epidermis and distinguish features between thick and thin skin, know the function of different cell types in the epidermis, delineate the different sensory receptors, recognize and describe skin appendices (in particular hair and glands)

## Integument
- integumentum = "to cover"
- composed of 
    - skin and
    - skin appendages (nails, hair follicles, glands)
- largest organ in body
- marked variation in structure at different sites

### Skin

#### Main functions
- **protection**
    - injury, infectious pathogens, UV radiation, shear stress
- **sensation**
    - receptors for touch, pressure, pain, temperature
- **thermoregulation**
    - vascular network, sweat
- **metabolism**
    - vitamin D production
- **removal of waste products**

#### Histology
- epidermis
- dermis
    - papillary layer
    - reticular layer
- subcutis

### Epidermis
- **5 layers = thick skin, 4 layers = thin skin**
1. stratum corneum
    - consists of keratin
    - sheds dead cells = desquamation
2. stratum lucidum **(only thick skin)**
    - densely packed cells without nuclei and organelles
    - appears glassy
3. stratum granulosum
    - cells undergo keratinization
    - granules with keratohyalin
4. stratum spinosum
    - synthesizes keratin (keratinocytes), langerhans cells and melanocytes
5. stratum basale
    - connected to basal lamina
    - cells divide (regeneration)
    - contains epidermal stem cells, melanocytes and merkel cells

#### Thick skin vs. thin skin
- **thick skin**
    - found on palms and soles
    - epidermis: 400-1400 μm(1.4 mm)
- **thin skin**
    - found elsewhere on body
    - epidermis: 75-150 μm

#### Epidermis: 4 cell types
- **keratinocytes** are highly specialized epithelial cells designed to perform a very specific function: **separation of the organism form its external environment**
    - account for 85% of cells in epidermis
- **melanocytes** are the **pigment-producing** cells of the epidermis
    - account for 5% of cells in epidermis
- **langerhans' cells** are the **antigen-presenting cells** involved in signaling in the immune system
    - account for 2-5% of cells in epidermis
- **merkel's cells** are **sensitive mechanoreceptor cells** associated with sensory nerve andings
    - account for 6-10% of cells in epidermis

##### Melanocytes
- located in basal layer
- synthesize pigment **melanin granules** and transfer them into neighboring **keratinocytes**
    - determines color of skin and hair
- transfer occurs through many long, branching melanocyte processes (not seen in routing microscopy)
- number of melanoctes equal in pale and dark skin - higher synthetic activity
- in light microscopy melanocytes **(M)** typically appaer as rounded, pale-staining or clear cells just above the dermis

##### Langerhans cells (dendritic cells)
- located in all layers, but mostly superficial part of stratum spinosum
- initiate **immune response** against pathogens
- phagocytic, antigen-processing and presenting cells of immune system
- account for 3-8% of cells in epidermis
- increase in numbers in inflammatory skin diseases e.g. contact dermatitis
- visible with immunostaining with antibody against CD1a

##### Merkel cell
- located in the basal layer
- abundant in highly sensitive skin
    - e.g. fingertips
- **sensitive to touch** (mechanoreceptors) 
    - release chemicals when compressed to stimualte sensory nerve endings
    - located adjacent to nerve endings
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/CBvNb6W.png =250x)

### Dermis
- a **layer of connective tissue**
    - supports epidermis and binds it to hypodermis (subcutaneous tissue)
    - contains blood vessels, nerves, sensory receptors
- **2 layers (no distinct boundary)**
    1. **papillary layer: loose connective tissue** with types I and III collagen fibers, fibroblasts and scattered mast cells, dendritic cells, and leuukocytes. Type VII collagen insert into the basal lamina.
    2. **reticular layer: dense irregular connective tissue** more fibers (mainly type I collagen and elastic), less cells, much thicker than papillary layer.
    3. **subcutaneous layer/hypodermis/superficial fascia: loose connective and adipose tissue** that binds skin to subjacent organs

### Sensory receptors of skin
- have 2 types with or without capsules of ollagen and modified Schwann cells
- most are difficult to see in routine preparations
- **no capsule:**
    - a) free nerve ending, root hair plexus
        - temperature, pain, itch
    - b) merkel cells
        - associated with tactile discs of nerve fibers: light touch, texture
- **capsule:**
    - c) lamellated (pacinian) corpuscles
        - detecting pressure and high-frequency vibration
    - d) krause end bulbs
        - low-frequency vibrations/movements, and cold
    - e) meissner (tactile) corpuscles
        - light touch
    - f) ruffini corpuscles
        - detecting tissue distortion

### Skin appendages
- are derieves from growths of epidermal epithelium during development
- **hair follicles** and their product: **hair**
- **sebaceous glands** and their product: **sebum**
- **eccrine sweat glands** and their product: **sweat**
- **apocrine sweat glands** and their mixed product containing a form of sweat with a high concentration of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins
![](https://i.imgur.com/btuRtT6.png =250x)

#### Hair
- **shaft** (outside) - **root** (embedded)
- **medulla (1) - cortex (2) - cuticle (3)** (from center to surface)
- **dermal papilla:**
    - keratinocytes proliferate and extend the hair root (hair growth)
![](https://i.imgur.com/4jzyyM7.png =250x)

#### Nails
- hard, keratinized skin derivatives formed in a process similar to that of hair
- growth: nail root **(NR)**, most proximal region of the nail plate **(NP)**, is formed like the hair root by a matrix of proliferating, differentiating keratinocytes

#### Sebaceous (oily) glands
- attached to hair
- 100 per cm^2^ more in face, forehead, scalp
- acinar glands
- holocrine secretion called sebum
    - helps maintain the stratum corneum and hair shafts and exerts weak antibacterial and antifungal properties

#### Eccrine sweat glands
- everywhere on skin, particularly palms, soles, forehead, axillae
- downgrowths from epidermis
- stratified cuboidal
- thermoregulation, excretion
- coiled secretory gland in dermis
- ducts open at skin surface
- merocrine: only secretions leave the cell (the cell stays intact and complete)
![](https://i.imgur.com/fB0Ifzf.png =250x)

#### Apocrine sweat gland
- present in axilla (armpit) and genital regions
- much larger than eccrine sweat glands
- ducts open into hair follicles
- simple cuboidal
- not functional until puberty
- merocrine secretion
- produce viscous secretion
    - initially odourless, but may acquire distinctive odour after bacterial decomposition
