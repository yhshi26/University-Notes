### Observations:
**Discuss the histological structure of the functional units of the mammary gland.**
A single mammary gland (breast) is composed of 15 to 20 irregular lobes. These are separated by septae, which are composed of fibrous bands of connective tissue and a low number of adipose cells. Each lobe connects to a single lactiferous duct, which acts as an intermediate between the lobe and the mammary papilla (nipple). The lactiferous ducts collect drainage from the lobes, and act as transport to the mammary papilla's opening. The lactiferous ducts are lined by a cuboidal or columnar cell bilayer enclosed by a sheath of connective tissue and myoid cells.

Each lobe can be subdivided into 20 to 40 terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs), which are the functional units of the mammary gland. 

The TDLUs of inactive/non-lactating mammary glands are composed of terminal ductules. Terminal ductules are branches of intralobular ducts lined with cuboidal secretory cells. During pregnancy, they differentiate into small secretory alveoli.

The TDLUs of active/lactating mammary glands are composed of secretory alveoli. Alveoli are cuboidal or columnar secretory cells that secrete milk, and they undergo growth and expansion during pregnancy.

The clusters of terminal ductules or alveoli in TDLUs are surrounded by intralobular stroma, which is specialized, hormone-sensitive loose connective tissue. Meanwhile interlobular stroma, which is composed of adipose and dense irregular connective tissue, keeps TDLUs separated. 

**Would you describe this specimen as (i) an inactive gland, (ii) an active, non-lactating gland, or (iii) an active, lactating gland, and why?**
This specimen is an active, non-lactating gland. 

It is first possible to recognize this specimen is active as it has high ratio of glandular tissue to stroma (connective tissue). Beyond that, the higher count of epithelial and myoepithelial cells, as well as the enlarged, more extensively branched secretory alveoli indicate that it must be an active mammary gland. 

Likewise, the specimen is non-lactating as proteinaceous milk is not present in the secretory alveoli, and adipocytes are present in relatively low numbers (compared to inactive mammary glands).

It can be inferred that this specimen probably comes from from a pregnant rat.

**Which cells are responsible for producing milk, and how is this milk projected to the nipple?**
Lactocytes lining alveoli are responsible for milk production in mammary glands. They secrete milk into alveoli, which transfer the fluid to intralobular collecting ducts. The intralobular collecting ducts connect to lactiferous ducts, which store milk in reservoirs called lactiferous sinuses to be projected to the mammary papilla via milk duct orifices.

During breastfeeding, suckling initiates sensory impulses to the hypothalamus from the nipple. These impulses trigger the release of multiple hormones, such as oxytocin from the neurohypophysis. The release of oxytocin specifically stimulates myoepithelial cells which are found in the epithelium and between epithelial cells and the basal lamina. They contract, facilitating milk ejection from the alveoli and lactiferous ducts. 

**Where do most invasive primary breast cancers arise?**
Most invasive primary breast cancers arise in the ducts or lobes of mammary glands. An example is invasive ductal carcinoma or infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC). IDC initiates in a milk duct, and spreads beyond the duct to the fibrous or fatty tissue of the mammary gland. ICD accounts for 80 percent of breast cancer diagnoses.

### Observations: 
**How does the histological structure of the tissue in this image compare to that of the non-lactating mammary gland?**
The tissue in this micrograph is from an active, lactating mammary gland. There are numerous differences between this active, lactating mammary gland and the non-lactating gland. 

Firstly, the active, lactating mammary gland has a higher ratio of glandular tissue to stroma. Likewise, the alveoli are enlarged and contain visibly clear apical cytoplasms. This is a result of the presence of glycogen and lipids in milk. Additionally, there is a relative increase in plasma cells and a decrease in fat cells (all relative to the non-lactating mammary gland).

### Observations:
**Describe how the microscopic structure of the lymph node allows it to function as a biological filter in the lymphatic circulation.**
Lymph nodes are ovoid-shaped organs that contain high numbers of lymphoid cells. Lymphoid cells allow for filtration of lymph on its passage through lymph nodes.

Lymph (and blood) vessels connect to the surface of lymph nodes via hilum. They contain valves to prevent backflow.  Afferent lymphatic vessels enter the surface for lymphocyte transport into the cell (arterioles play a role in this as well). Efferent lymphatic vessels leave the surface for lymph drainage.

Lymph nodes are subdivided at the cortex into connective tissue capsule and septa. When lymph enters a lymph node, it passes through the capsule to enter the cortex. There, it is filtered through a reticular meshwork containing macrophages and reticular, dendritic, and follicular dendritic cells. These interact with B and T cells dispersed in the superficial and deep cortices, and medulla.

Passing through a lymph node, lymph is brought in close proximity to B cells, T cells, and antigen-presenting cells. Most B cells are found in the superficial cortex, whereas T cells are mainly found in the deep cortex. 

**How does blood and lymph enter and leave the lymph node?**
Lymph contains white blood cells and lymphocytes. It passes the capsule and enters the cortex of the lymph node via several afferent lymphatic vessels. It then leaves the lymph node, filtering through a reticular meshwork (macrophages, and reticular, dendritic, and follicular dendritic cells) interacting with B and T cells dispersed in the superficial and deep cortices, and medulla. Lymph exits via a single efferent lymphatic vessel.

**What are the major cell types present in the lymph node and how do they function?**
The major cells present in lymph nodes fall under a category of white blood cells called lymphocytes. Lymphocytes can be subcategorized as B and T lymphocytes (or cells), which work to fight off disease. 

B and T cells are both present in lymph nodes. B cells are mainly localized in the superficial cortex of lymph nodes, while T cells are mainly in the deep cortex. 

B cells provide humoral immunity by producing antibodies to combat pathogens. B cells recognize antigens on pathogens in order to activate, producing memory and effector cells (antibodies). The antibodies bind to antigens and attack.

T cells provide cell-mediated immunity in which no antibodies are involved. T cells recognize antigen fragments displayed by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on infected cells. There are two types of T cells: helper T cells, and cytotoxic (killer) T cells.

Helper T cells recognize class two MHC molecules, and use CD4 proteins to bind. Once activated, they alert the immune system of antigens, causing B cells and killer T cells to activate and attack.

Killer T cells recognize class one MHC molecules, and use CD8 protein to bind. Once activated, they create clones of effector and memory cells, and secrete enzymes to directly attack an infected cell membrane.

**What might be the cause of lymph node enlargement?**
Lymph nodes may enlargen during infections. This occurs due to lymph nodes producing more lymphocytes, resulting in swelling of the lymph node. Lymph nodes become easier to palpate when this happens, as they also become more stiff to the touch.

Other potential causes of lymph node enlargement inclued conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, and in rare cases, diseases like cancer.

### Observations: 
**Describe the microscopic structure of thymic cortex and medulla.**
The thymic cortex is highly populated by thymocytes (immature T cells), but also contains small numbers of associated epithelial cells. For example, epithelial reticular cells form a network to support thymocytes. This network is continuous with a similar system in the thymic medulla. As the microenvironment of the thymic cortex is antigen-free, it is considered a primary lymphoid organ. 

The thymic medulla contains mature T cells, and epithelial cells are in higher numbers. Like the thymic cortex, the thymic medulla has a network of epithelial reticular cells for support. This network is relatively coarser, and the count of lymphoid cells is lower. Beyond that are Hassall's corpuscles (thymic corpuscles), which are concentric loops formed by clusters of epithelial cells. As antigens can enter the microenvironment of the thymic medulla, it is considered a secondary lymphoid environment.

**What forms the supportive structures of the cortex and medulla?**
Epithelial reticular cells and fibroblasts form supportive structures in the thymic cortex and medulla. Epithelial reticular cells form structural frameworks in the thymic cortex and medulla, allowing immature T cells and mature T cells to be separated in the thymus. Fibroblasts, which are mostly around the vessels, capsule, and thymic medulla produce collagenous substances and connective tissues for structural support.

**Do lymphoid follicles with germinal centres exist in the thymus?**
No, lymphoid follicles with germinal centres exist in secondary lymphoid organs, while the thymus is a primary lymphoid organ. Therefore, lymphoid follicles with germinal centres do not exist in the thymus.

**What happens to the specific thymus tissue organisation in puberty?**
The thymus is near fully developed after birth, but after puberty, undergoes subsequent changes through involution. The thymic cortex loses density due to a replacement of lymphocytes and epithelial reticular cells with adipose tissue. Even with that loss, the thymus of an adult is still able to produce (relatively lower quantities) of T cells. Meanwhile, the thymic medulla gains thymic corpuscles.
