# CAL 1: Bone and skin
###### tags: `ANAT20030 - basic tissues, early dev`

> In this particular session, you will be analysing and describing the microscopic architecture of some important connective tissues: bone (including cartilage), and epithelial tissue: skin. There are four digital slides in this slidebox: bone (developing, compact), skin (non-hairy, hairy).

## Developing Bone (Epiphyseal Plate)
> This slide is a digitised image of a section illustrating the end of a long bone (source: femur). Locate and identify particular structures on this tissue with the aid of a textbook/lecture notes/web resources. Prepare a write-up on the functional histology of this tissue (included in your notebook opposite the drawing). This writeup must include answering the observation questions below.

> Magnification: A suitable area of this tissue should be drawn at 10-15x.

### Features: 
Enchondral ossification zones: 1 reserve (or resting) cartilage; 2 proliferation; 3 hypertrophy; 4 calcified cartilage; 5 ossification. Osteoblast, osteocytes, chondrocytes, lacunae, isogenous groups, territorial matrix, interterritorial matrix, bone marrow cavities, bone spicules.

### Observations: 
This slide displays the epiphyseal plate of the femur, which is composed of **hyaline cartilage**. Hyaline cartilage **differs from fibrous cartilage** in that it has a softer texture and less collagen fibers. It also **differs from elastic cartilage** in how it has a glassy appearance (whereas elastic cartilage is yellow).

Cartilage growth occurs through the mechanisms of  **interstitial and appositional growth**. Interstitial growth involves an increase in bone length, while appositional growth involves an increase in bone diameter.

The epiphyseal plate is a growth plate **found in the metaphysis**. The metaphysis includes regions between the epiphysis and diaphysis of bones. These regions lie on either side of the epiphyseal plate, and are **composed of spongy and compact bone respectively**. 

**Endochondral ossification** is a process of bone formation that takes approximately 12 weeks to complete. This process takes mesenchyme and turns it into a cartilage intermediate which is then transformed into bone. This begins with the development of a hyaline cartilage model. Some of the cartilage calcifies, followed by primary and secondary ossification. Then, cartilage is replaced by bone. **The following labelled micrograph demonstrates the epiphyseal plate:**

The zones are indicated by their respective labels in order: **resting cartilage, proliferation, hypertrophy, calcified cartilage and ossification**. The resting cartilage consists of small, scattered osteons, which become larger in the proliferating cartilage. The hypertrophic cartilage consists maturing osteons which die off to form calcified cartilage. The final zone, ossification, involves osteoclasts dissolving the calcified cartilage, allowing osteoblasts and capillaries in the area to form bone. 

Some artifacts may be noted in the micrograph. **An example is tissue folding visible in the following micrograph section:**

> Magnification: A suitable area of these slides should be drawn at 20-30x. Ignore areas of the slides that may be out-of-focus.

### Features: 
Lamellae; Osteon: Osteocytes; Haversian canals; canaliculi (bone channels); Volkmann’s canals; periosteum; lacunae (bone cavities) 

### Observations: 

Compact and spongy bone differ in their composition; **while compact bone is composed of osteons, spongy bone is made up of trabeculae (hence the alternate name "trabecular" bone)**. There are other differences including localization, as compact bone comprises the outer and spongy bone the inner layers of bones. 

Compact bone surrounds the medullary cavity (bone marrow), providing strength and protection. **The structural arrangement of compact bone allows for this**, as osteons are oriented parallel to the longer edges of the bone, making the bone more resistant to stress. **The structure of compact bone is delineated in the following labelled micrograph:** 

#### Figure 1 - compact bone transverse section, mag. 20X

Osteons communicate with one another and the periosteum **via Volkmann's canals**. Volkmann's canals are comprised of blood vessels and nerves, supplying osteons with nourishment and a method of intercommunication. 

The central region of the transverse section of compact bone **contains osteons, which in turn consist of haversian canals**. The haversian canal provides a network of blood vessels, and is surrounded by a thin membrane called lamella (pl. lamellae).

Maintaining healthy bone entails a balance between bone formation and resorption. **Sometimes, there may be an imbalance, leading to various pathologies such as osteopenia and osteoperosis, and osteopetrosis**.

**Osteopenia and osteoporosis occur when there is excessive bone resorption**; more osteoclast activity than necessary results in a loss of bone density. This makes bones more prone to fracturing and can result in visible symptoms such as stooped posture. DEXA (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) scans can measure bone density and provides a T-score, comparing the patient's bone density to that of a healthy 30 year old of the same sex. A score of -1 to -2.5 is considered osteopenia, while anything below -2.5 is osteoperosis.

**Osteopetrosis involves excessive bone formation**. Osteoclasts fail to resorb bone, meaning osteoblast activity continues unconstrained, resulting in a higher bone density. This leads to more brittle bones which are at a higher risk of fracturing. 


## Skin (non-hairy)
> The first slide in this session is a digitised image of a section of skin. Locate and identify particular structures on this tissue with the aid of a textbook/lecture notes/web resources. An appropriate area of the slide, which includes suitable defining features, should be drawn in your laboratory notebook, accompanied by appropriate labels, scale bars and magnification. Prepare a write-up on the functional histology of this tissue (included in your notebook opposite the drawing).
>
> Magnification: A suitable area of this tissue should be drawn at 10x. Specific features will require higher magnification.

### Features: 
Epidermis and its associated layers (stratum-corneum, -lucidum, -granulosum, -spinosum, -basale); epidermal ridges; papillary dermis; reticular dermis; dermal papillae; eccrine glands & ducts; blood vessels, fibroblasts, keratinocytes.

### Observations: 

This micrograph section was **taken from thick skin**. In the epidermal layer are 5 distinguishable layers of keratinocytes **in the stratum basale, spinosum, granulosum, lucidum, and corneum**. These layers are formed after keratinocytes are synthesized in the basal lamina and migrate to more superficial layers, simultaneously maturing and differentiating. 

The **stratum basale** is just superficial to the basal lamina, and is the first site keratinocytes reach after proliferating. As they continue moving upward, keratinocytes reach the **stratum spinosum**, where keratin, Langerhans cells and melanocyte are synthesized. After that is the **stratum granulosum** which contains granules with keratohyalin, and is a layer involving cells keratinizing. This is just deep to the stratum corneum, however in thick skin, a thin layer - the **stratum lucidum** - forms a glassy region of densely packed cells with no nuclei or organelles between them. Finally, the keratinocytes reach the **stratum corneum**, the most superficial layer, which consists of keratin.

A variety of cell types may be found in the epidermis, including: **keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel's cells**. Keratinocytes act as a barrier between organisms and their environments, melanocytes produce pigment, Langerhans cells are involved in immune processes, and Merkel's cells serve as mechanoreceptors.

The dermis is comprised of 2 layers: the papillary layer and reticular layer. The papillary layer is made up of **loose connective tissue**, and the reticular layer **dense irregular connective tissue**.

#### Figure 2 - papillary → reticular dermis, mag. 10X

**A variety of structures can be found in the dermis on this slide**. Find fibroblasts (function: synthesize connective tissue, repair), blood vessels (provide nutrients, regulate temperature), eccrine glands (regulate temperature) and ducts labelled in the following figure:

#### Figure 3 - dermis and various functional structures, mag. 10X
![](https://i.imgur.com/zUPFMMo.jpg)

Fibroblasts appear as **specks throughout the dermis**, while blood vessels appear much larger and may be distinguished by their tubular appearance. To differentiate the structures of arteries and veins, **arteries have relatively thicker walls, and a lower wall to lumen ratio**. Eccrine glands are even larger, **consisting of secretory and excretory structures including eccrine ducts**.

There are **no sebaceous glands or hair** in this preparation, as these accessory structures are not found in thick skin.


## Scalp
> The second slide in this session is a digitised image of a section of hairy skin (scalp). Locate and identify particular structures on this tissue with the aid of a textbook/lecture notes/web resources. Prepare a write-up on the functional histology of this tissue (included in your notebook opposite the drawing). 
> 
> Magnification: A suitable area of this tissue should be drawn at 15-20x. 

### Features: 
Hair follicle (cortex; medulla; cuticle; internal root sheath; external root sheath; glassy membrane; connective tissue sheath; papilla); sebaceous gland; sweat gland; arrector pili muscle; subcutaneous tissue; dermis; epidermis.

### Observations: 

As one approaches the right edge of the sectioned hair follicles, there is a visible change in the appearance of the tissue. **These differences may arise from how the tissue was sectioned**. It appears that to the left are hair follicles still in development, probably in the subcutaneous tissue. Approaching the right, the tissue is visibly more mature, probably in the epidermis layer.

Hair follicles anchor hair into skin. **At the base of hair follicles is a hair bulb** where living cells proliferate to produce a hair shaft. **Blood vessels transport nourishment and hormones** to the proliferating cells, influencing hair development and quality.

Sebaceous glands synthesize sebum, an oily substance. It is secreted to **provide skin with lubrication to prevent excess friction, and help skin retain its moisture**.
