## Gametogenesis
- sparmatogenesis: production of sperm
- oogenesis: production of oocytes

## Spermatogenesis
- spermatocytogenesis: meiosis
- spermiogenesis: formation of highly differentiated spermatozoa with their typical form

### Spermatocytogenesis
- **before puberty:**
    - primordial germ cells migrate from yold sac into indifferent gonad
    - migration of cells into medulla of testis
    - differentiation to spermatogonia
- **after puberty:**
    - formation of A~1~- und A~2~-spermatogonia
    - A~2~:B~1~ und B~2~-spermatogonia
    - formation of primary spermatocytes

### Spermatogenesis
- takes place in the testis
- occurs in waves, and is different based on site in testis where it occurs (e.g. seminiferous tubule)
- spermatogenesis: 64 days
    - leydig cells: testosterone
    - sertoli cells: essential for integrity of spermatogenesis (cytoplasmic bridges), providing nutrients, phagocytosis, blood-testis-barrier

### Spermiogenesis
- nucleus: condensation
- formation of flagellum
- formation of acrosome
- mitochondria gathered at the midpiece
- removal of excess cytoplasm

## Structures
### Spermatozoa
- head
- tail

### Spermatozoon
- head (with acrosome)
- tail
- neck (centriol)
- midpiece (mitochondria)
- principle piece
- end piece

## Maturation of sperm in the epididymis
- serves as a reservoir for sperm, with their passage taking 1-21 days, **sperm maturation**
- 2-3 m long duct
- sperm acquire fertilizing capacity, high motility
- sperm pathway:
    - tubili sminiferi → tubuli recti → rete testis → ductuli efferentes → ductus epididymidis → ductus deferens → urethra

### Ejaculate
- spermatozoa and seminal plasma
    - serminal plasma from accessory glands
    - transport medium
    - enables survival (pH)
    - energy source
- parameters of fertile and infertile men:

## Oogenesis
- proliferation
- growth
- maturation
    - continuation of meiosis

### Proliferation
- migration of primordial germ cells from yolk sac into indifferent gonad
- migration into cortex of ovary
- differentiation to oogonia: mitosis
    - proliferation finishes at birth

### Growth
- PGCs start meiosis 1 (prophase): **primary oocyte**
- meiosis is stopped until puberty
- formation of **follicles =** oocyte and accompanying cells (follicle cells)

#### Growth: folliculogenesis
- primordial follicle:
    - in groups, flat epithelium
- primary follicle
    - isoprimatic, epithelium
- secondary follicle
    - multi-layered follicular epithelium, **zona pellucida**
- tertiary follicle
    - antrum folliculare, cumulus oophorus, corona radiata, theca interna/externa
- graaf follicle: ovulation
- **follicular atresia**

### Maturation
- meiosis starts during embryonic deelopment
- continuation during folliculogenessi
- meiosis I finished at **ovulation**
- meiosis II finished after **fertilization**
- from one primary oocyte:
    - **1 oocyte and 3 polar bodies**

### Corpus luteum (Cl)
- corpus luteum periodicum
    - corpus hemorrhagicum (Cl in formation)
    - corpus albicans (Cl in regression)
- corpus luteum graviditatis
- granulosa lutein cells, theka lutein cells
- hormone gland: **progesterone**

## Structure of oocyte
- largest cell in body
- zona pellucide
- plasmalemm with microvilli
- cortical granules
- fat (yolk) vacuoles
- mitochondria, golgi-apparatus, ER
