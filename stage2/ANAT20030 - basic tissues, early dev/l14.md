> learning objectives: define sensory receptor; classify receptors by function, structure, adaptive properties and anatomical location; discuss most common examples of different types of specialised sensory receptors

## Components of sensory pathway
- stimulus
- receptor
- nerve fibre
- tracts
- [cerebellum (unconscious)]
- thalamus
- sensory cortex (conscious)

### Sensory receptors
- structures that recognise a stimulus in the internal or external environment of an individual
- nerve endings or specialised cells which **convert** stimuli from external or internal environment into **afferent nerve impulses**
- impulse passes into CNS where it initiates appropriate voluntary or involuntary responses

#### Sensory (generator) potential
- depolarisation induced in the **terminal of a sensory receptor,** which if sufficiently large can initiate an action potential in the sensory axon (may be a separate or same cell)
- produced by **sensory transduction** (transformation of stimulus into electric current) → membrane depolarisation → an action potential
- e.g. **taste bud,** where taste is converted into an electrical signal sent to brain:
    - when stimulated, taste bud triggers release of neurotransmitter within synapse, which will stimulate first order neuron to generate action potential which may propagate along axon into CNS

#### Receptors act as transducers
- sensory receptors provide information about location, intensity, and duration of a peripheral stimulus
- receptors are designed to chagne (transduce) one kind of energy into another (i.e. touch to electrochemical nerve impulse)

#### Sensory receptors: characteristics
- information carried in a sensory system may or may not lead to **conscious awareness** of the stimulus
- the transduction process from sensory receptors invovles **opening or closing ion channels** in the receptor
- ions flow across the membrane, causing a receptor action potential
- amplitude of a receptor (generator) potential increases as stimulus strength and frequency of stimulation increases
- **adaptation** is change over time in the **responsiveness** of the sensory system to a **constant stimulus**

##### Sensory nerves
- different sensory receptors are innervated by different types of nerve fibers
    - **muscles** are innervates by **type I and II** fibres
    - **skin receptors** are innervted by alpha-beta, alpha-delta, and C fibres

### Classification of sensory receptors
- **anatomical location:**
    - **exteroreceptors**
        - respond to sitmulus outside the body (touch, pressure, pain, etc.)
    - **proprioceptors**
        - respond to information on position, orientation, movement and tension
        - e.g. vestibular apparatus in ear, tendon organs, neuromuscular spindles in skeletal muscle
    - **interoceptors (viscerorrecptors)**
        - respond to stimulus from viscera
        - e.g. chemoreceptors in blood vessels, receptors in bladder wall (distension)
- **function:**
    - **electroreceptors:** electric fields (ampulla of lorenzini)
    - **baroreceptors:** pressure
    - **chemoreceptors:** chemical sitmuli
    - **hydroreceptors:** humidity
    - **mechanoreceptors:** mechanical stress
    - **nociceptors:** pain
    - **osmoreceptors:** osmolarity of fluids (hypothalamus)
    - **photoreceptors:** light 
    - **proprioceptors:** change in position
    - **thermoreceptors:** temperature change
- **adaptive properties:**
    - slowly adaptic **(tonic):**
        - information about **ongoing stimulation**
        - continue to discahrge during stimulation
        - e.g. ruffini nerve ending
    - rapidly adaptive **(phasic):**
        - information about **changing stimuli**
        - respond only when stimulation starts or ends
        - e.g. pacinian corpuscle receptor
- **structure:**
    - **non-encapsulated:**
        - free nerve endings (terminal branches of neuron)
        - terminal branches are unmyelinated
        - examples:
            - nociceptors and thermoreceptors
        - widest distribution throughout body
            - dermis and epidermis
            - skin, mucous membranes, joints, and other sites
            - located in epithelium and other layers in addition to blood vessels
        - respond directly to a wide variety of stimuli (pain, touch, pressure, tension)
    - **encapsulated:**
        - myelinated
        - specialised function
        - consist of remaining type of cutaneous receptors
        - examples:
            - meissner tactile corpuscles
            - pacinian corpuscles
            - ruffini endings
            - end bulbs
            - neuromuscular spindles
            - tendon organs of golgi

#### Meissner tactile corpuscles
- elongated spirals of receptor endings encapsulated in connective tissue
- locted in dermis
- distributed widely in skin (esp. finger, palm of hand, plantar surface of foot, toes, nipples, lips)
- rapidly adapting
- stimulus: moving touch (to report moving objects on skin); sensitive to shape and textural changes in exploratory touch (neural basis for braille reading); slow vibration

#### Pacinian corpuscle
- most widely distributed encapsulated receptor
- almost one third are in fingers
- examples:
    - elliptical capsule
    - concentric lamellae of fibroblasts and collagenous tissue
- invests the unmyelinated distal segment of a large myelinated (alpha-beta) axon
- histologically, appear like divided onion
- sensitive to fast vibration and deep pressure

#### Ruffini endings
- elongated and complex
- dermis of skin (fingertipes), joint capsule
- slowly adapting mechanoreceptors
- sensation of pressure

#### End bulb
- end bulb of krause
- have been associated with sensations of temperature

#### Muscle spindles
- abundant in muscles that control fine movement
- specialised striated fibres in a capsule parallel to the surrounding skeletal muscle fibres
- contain both afferent and efferent muscle fibres
- activity stops with relaxation of tension in spindle (when skeletal muscle contracts)
- when a muscle is stretched by tapping its tendon, the stimulated receptor endings initiate an impulse in the afferent nerves which stimulates the **alpha motor neurons** and results in a **reflecs of muscle contraction**; this is the basis of all monosynaptic strecth reflexes (e.g. **knee jerk**)

#### Tendon organ of golgi
- slowly-adapting receptor
- located in tendons, close to junction with skeetal muscle
- fasciciles of tendon ensheathed by connective tissue
- when a muscle (along with its tendon) is stretched excessively, the muscle relaxes

#### E.g. visual pathway
- light converted to sensory impulse by **rods and cones** in retina
- primary visual cortex located in **occipital lobe** at back of brain
