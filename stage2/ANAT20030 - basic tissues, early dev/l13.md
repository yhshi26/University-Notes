[13_Peripheral nerves and ganglia (Dr. T. Flanagan)](https://brightspace.ucd.ie/d2l/le/content/155871/viewContent/1674331/View)

> learning objectives: know major structural and functional components of peripheral nervous system (inc. ganglia); know major differences between spinal and cranial nerves; know structure, function and divisions of autonomic nervous system

## Peripheral nervous system
- link between CNS and **peripheral** structures (e.g. skin receptors, muscles)
- **cranial** nerves, **spinal** nerves, **ganglia** and **nerve plexuses**
- **autonomic** nervous system

### Types of nerves
- **sensory nerves:** mostly sensory neurons
- **motor nerves:** mostly motor neurons
- **mixed nerves:** a combination of sensory and motor neurons

### Ganglion (pl. ganglia)
- a mass of nerve cell bodies (plus dendrites/synapses) associated with nerves of PNS
- serve as relay stations
    - e.g. **dorsal root ganglia** (spinal ganglia) = cell bodies of **sensory** neurons
    - **autonomic ganglia** = cell bodies of **autonomic** neurons

### Nerve plexuses
- web-like interconnected fibres from many different nerves
    - e.g. spinal nerve plexuses: fibres from several spinal nerves come together
    - autonomic plexuses

## Peripheral nervous system (PNS)
- functional components:
    - sensory inputs and motor outputs
        - categorised as **somatic** or **visceral**
            - somatic: innervated skeletal **(voluntary)** muscles
            - visceral (autonomic): innervate smooth and cardiac **(involuntary)** muscles and glands
        - these can be further categorised as **general** or **special**

### Functional organisation of PNS

### Anatomical organisation of PNS
- consists of 43 pairs of nerves branching from CNS:
    - 12 pairs of **cranial** nerves
    - 31 pairs of **spinal** nerves

#### Spinal nerves
- 31 pairs: all **mixed** nerves
- named according to level of vertebral column from which they arise:
    - 8 pairs cervical (C1-C8)
    - 12 pairs thoracic (T1-T12)
    - 5 pairs lumbar (L1-L5)
    - 5 pairs sacral (S1-S5)
    - 1 pair coccygeal (Co1)
- arise from spinal cord by two **roots:**
    - ventral (anterior) roots contain mainly **motor** (efferent) neurons
    - dorsal (posterior) roots contain mainly **sensory** (afferent) neurons (plus ganglion)
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/nETCQ01.png =250x)
- spinal nerve then divides into two branches **(rami):**
    - dorsal (posterior) ramus: **sensory** (blue)
    - ventral (anterior) ramus: **motor** (red)
    - spinal nerve and rami are **mixed**

#### Cranial nerves
- **peripheral** nervous system
    - **cranial** nerves are equivalent to **spinal** nerves, only they arise from the forebrain (I and II) or brainstem (III-XII)
    - unlike spinal nerves, some are **motor** only, **sensory** only, or **mixed**
    - some have **autonomic** fibres

#### Cranial nerves (next year)
- 12 nerves, bilaterally paired
- named and numbered (roman) according to sequence in which they attach to brain (from head to toe)
- know names and major functions
- components
- nuclei (contact points in brainstem not spinal cord)
- course
- clinical considerations

## Autonomic nervous system
![](https://i.imgur.com/JRm2FTJ.png =450x)
- autonomic = "self-governed"
- involuntary effectors (smooth/cardiac muscles, glands)
- divided into **sympathetic** and **parasympathetic**
- generally opposing effects
- ANS unique in that there are **2 neurons** between spinal cord and target organ

### Comparison of autonomic and somatic motor systems
![](https://i.imgur.com/mnHHeL7.png =450x)

### Structure of sympathetic division
- formed by neurons from **spinal nerves T1-L2 (thoracolumbar outflow)**
- sympathetic neuron cell bodies located in **lateral horn;** neuron leaves via ventral root
![](https://i.imgur.com/d9ImOfM.png =250x)
- sympathetic neurons branch from spinal nerves to form inter-connected ganglia **(sympathetic chain)**
- **pre- and post-ganglionic neurons** can synapse here **(paravertebral ganglia)** or in distal ganglia **(prevertebral)**
- post-ganglionic neuron continues to effector organ

### Function of sympathetic division:
- fight or flight system
- exciting effect

### Structure of paratympathetic division
- formed by neurons in **cranial nerves (III, VII, IX, X)** and fibres in some **sacral** (S2-S4) nerves **(craniosacral outflow)**
- no chain ganglia
- ganglia usually **near** or within walls of target organ

### Function of parasympathetic division:
- rest and digest system
- relaxing effect: reduced energy expidenture, normal body maintenance
- no mass activation: organs individually activated

### Interactions between symp/parasympathetic
- **body does not alternate between only symp/parasympathetic activity**
- normally, both systems are active (baseline levels of 'autonomic tone')
    - e.g. parasympathetic maintains intestinal muscle tone and keeps heart rate down to 70 bpm
    - sympathetic maintains smooth muscle tone around most vessels to maintain blood pressure
