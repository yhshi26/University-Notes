## Fight or flight response
- overwhelming activation of sympathetic nervous system
    - noradrenaline (NAd - AKA Norepinephrine - NE)
- activation of adrenal glands
    - splanchnic nerve
    - release of adrenaline (epinephrine) and NAd
    - Ad:NAd (80:20)
    - 1-3 min half life

### Architecture of somatic vs. autonomic nervous system

## Autonomic nervous system (ANS)

### Branches of ANS trigger different responses due to different signals
- parasympathetic nervous system
    - acetylcholine
    - cholinergic
    - muscarinic acetylcholine receptors
- sympathetic nervous system
    - adrenaline/noradrenaline
    - adrenergic receptors

## Heterogeneity in sympathetic responses
- bronchial smooth muscle dialation
- contraction of vascular smooth muscle in gut
- dilation of vascular smooth muscle in skeletal muscle
- contraction of vascular smooth muscle in skin

### Variety
- adrenaline and noradrenaline great signalling molecules
- used to direct many responses
- heterogeneity comes from:
    - variety of receptors
        - variety of intracellular cascades
    - tissue specific receptor expression
    - varied affinity/potency at different receptors

### Varied responses of NAd and Ad

### GPCRs in medicine: adrenergic receptors
- catecholamines: e.g. adrenaline
- alpha receptors in CNS and PNS
    - a1-Gq coupled
        - post-synaptic
        - smooth muscle: vasoconstriction
    - a2-Gi coupled
        - pre-synaptic: inhibitor NAd release
        - post-synaptic: liver, platelets, blood vessel constriction
- beta receptors: Gs coupled
    - B1-Gs coupled-post-synaptic
        - heart rate/cardiac output (blocked by propanolol)
    - B2-Gs coupled-smooth muscle dilation (bronchial: asthma)

### How NAd causes contraction (alpha adrenoceptor) (lecture 14)

## Adrenoceptor types
### Alpha 1 adrenoceptor (smooth muscle, gut and genitourinary)

### Beta 1 adrenoceptor (cardiac muscle)

### Beta 2 adrenoceptor (vascular smooth muscle)

#### Bronchodilation (reflex)

### Receptor affinities

| adrenoceptor     | potency   |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| a1-adrenoceptors | Ad >= NAd |
| b1-adrenoceptors | Ad = NAd  |
| b2-adrenoceptors | Ad >> NAd |

#### Relevance of affinity: e.g. vascular smooth muscle ([a1]>>[b2]; affinity b2>>a1)

## Summary
- within a tissu,e the most numerous receptor type is likely to dominate the response to a given ligand
    - varied intracellular signalling cascade
    - or varied intracellular targets
- however, if there are multiple receptor sub-types and more than one related ligand, it is likely that receptor affinity and ligand concentration will dictate outcome
