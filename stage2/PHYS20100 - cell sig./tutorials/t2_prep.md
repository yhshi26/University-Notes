## Notes
### Sodium (Na^+^)/potassium (K^+^) pump (ATPase):
- sodium-potassium pumps (or Na^+^/K^+^ -ATPase) are transmembrane proteins that actively transports Na^+^ ions to the extracellular fluid, and K^+^ ions to the intracellular fluid using the following steps:
    - 3 Na^+^ ions from the intracellular fluid bind to the pump (with ATP attached)
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/2Lv30xH.png =250x)
    - the pump is phosphorylated after the third phosphate on the ATP is hydrolyzed by ATPase
        - this triggers the 3 Na^+^ to be released to the extracellular fluid as the pump changes conformation (shape)
    - 2 K^+^ ions fron the extracellular fluid bind to the pump
        - the 2 K^+^ ions trigger dephosphorylation of the pump
        - the 2 K^+^ ions are released to the intracellular fluid as the pump changes conformation due to dephosphorylation
    - as a result, both chemical (diffusion) and electrical gradients are created

### Unmyelinated and myelinated axons
- larger diameter axons tend to be myelinated (covered by a myelin sheath) which allows them to conduct action potentials at greater velocities than smaller diameter unmyelinated axons
![](https://i.imgur.com/SfMvNVs.png =250x)
- myelin sheaths are formed by schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system, and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system
![](https://i.imgur.com/Vg3K9Vv.png =250x)
- the sheaths consist of a series of myelinated segments, each extending approx 1 mm along the outer surface of the axon
    - the segments are separated by small gaps (approx 1 micrometer) called nodes of ranvier
    - schwann cells and oligodendrocytes form coats of myelin by wrapping the axon with concentric layers of their cell membranes which are mostly lipid
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/RFVMdLU.png =250x)
    - the layer of insulation created by the myelin coat inhibits current loss from the axon by blocking movement of ions through the axon membrane
    - ion channels in myelinated neurons are therefore mostly concentrated in the nodes of ranvier, whereas ion channels in unmyelinated axons span the entire length of the axon
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/MAVbmk8.png =250x)

### Axons resting potential
- when axons are not conducting impulses (action potentials or depolarization events), they are at rest
    - unlike the term implies, resting neurons actually expend a lot of energy (ATP)
- most of the ions are distributed by transporter and channel proteins embedded in the axon membrane
![](https://i.imgur.com/TjZruj6.png =250x)
- the disperal of charged particles causes the membrane to slightly polarize
- the intracellular fluid becomes relatively negative compared to the extracellular fluid
![](https://i.imgur.com/G1Wpzko.png =250x)
- as long as the polarized state is maintained, axons will not produce an impulse but are ready to do so

### Resting potential factors
- the plasma membranes of resting axons are slightly polarized due to unequal distribution of Na^+^, K^+^, Cl^-^ and protein- ions in extracellular and intracellular fluid
- several factors play a role in creating the resting membrane potential
- Na^+^/K^+^ pumps (or Na^+^/K^+^ -ATPases) move Na^+^ and K^+^ ions to opposite sides of the membrane
![](https://i.imgur.com/kJmKiLT.png =250x)
- each pump protein uses one ATP to tranfer 3 Na^+^ ions out the cell and 2 K^+^ ions in
    - as a result, Na^+^ ions are concentrated outside the axon membrane and K^+^ ions are concentrated inside; the unequal transfer of ions contributed slightly to the polarity of the resting membrane
    - very few of the Na^+^ ions can diffuse back into the cell because most of the gated Na^+^ channels are closed
    - most of the K^+^ channels are also closed, however many leak channels remain open, increasing membrane's permeability to K^+^ ions 
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/KKmmnJi.png =250x)
        - as K^+^ ions diffuse outward, the interior of the membrane becomes more negative and the exterior more positive, significantly altering the RMP
- proteins- and other large anions confined within the cell also contribute to the membrane's polarity
- an equilibrium is quickly reached between the outward diffusion gradient for K^+^ and the inward electrical gradient
![](https://i.imgur.com/1sOreOB.png =250x)
- the opposing forces slow the net outflow of K^+^ ions and the RMP stabilizes around -70mV
    - as the RMP stabilizes, Cl^-^ ions passively disperse based on the permeability and polarity of the plasma membrane; becasue the intracellular fluid is relatively negative, Cl^-^ ions are repelled and tend to concentrate outside of the membrane

### Action potential events
- at rest, the axon membrane is slightly polarized to about -70mV, meaning the intracellular fluid is relatively negative to the extracellular fluid
![](https://i.imgur.com/OCdATGI.png =250x)
- an action potential occurs when a portion of the membrane rapidly depolarizes and repolarizes again to the initial resting state
- the process is initiated by a threshold level stimulus such as a nearby change in membrane potential (threshold potential, local potential)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/9ZuJ6h5.png =250x)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/GIkX4RO.png =250x)
- at threshold (approx -55mV), many Na^+^ voltage-gated channels open
    - Na^+^ ions entering the cell make the membrane potential less negative; more Na^+^ channels open as a result and a cycle of depolarization develops
- when the membrane potential reaches approx +30mV (reverse polarization), the timed Na^+^ channels close due to inactivation and Na^+^ influx halts
    - K^+^ voltage-gated channels open as Na^+^ channels close in a delayed response to the original stimulus
    - K^+^ ions diffuse out the cell and the efflux of positive charges causes the membrane to rapidly repolarize
- the K^+^ channels are slow to close, so the membrane briefly hyperpolarizes
    - as the K^+^ channels close, Na^+^/K^+^ pumps actively transport Na^+^ ions out the cell and K^+^ ions in the cell
    - the ion exchange helps re-establish the ion diffusion gradients and resting membrane potential
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ryxab0m.png =250x)
- lastly, the Na^+^ channels close (dein-activate) as the resting potential returns

### Neurotransmitter release at cholinergic synapses
- cholinergic synapses are chemical synapses that use acetylcholine molecules as the neurotrasmitter
- synaptic transmission begins when an action potential or electrochemical impulse reaches the synaptic knob of a presynaptic neuron
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/lBiDcV9.png =250x)
- Ca^2+^ channels open in response, and Ca^2+@ ions diffuse into the synaptic nob; the influx of Ca^2+^ causes many of the syaptic vesiles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane
    - as the vesicles fuse, thousands of stored acetylcholine (ACh) transmitter molecules are released into the synaptic cleft
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/f8pJHxK.png =250x)
- a few of these molecules diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to the acetylcholine receptors that are embedded in the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron

### Cholinergic synaptic events
- impulse travels down presynaptic neuron
- Ca^2+^ enters synaptic knob through channels
- synaptic vesicles fuse with membrane and ACh binds to receptors
- ACh receptors ope
- (more) Na^+^ diffuses in
- (less) K^+^ diffuses out
- postsynaptic membrane depolarizes
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/X2kCkwO.png =250x)
- ACh broken down by acetylcholinesterase
- ACh receptors close
- Na-K pump restores ion gradients
- postsynaptic membrane repolarizes
