## Smooth muscle function: squeezing
- vascular tone
    - blood pressure
    - perfusion of organs
        - **pulmonary hypertension (condition)**
- airway diameter
    - regulation of ventilation
        - **asthma (condition)**
- GI transit (peristalsis)
- sphincters
- glandular secretions

| Location | Function | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| blood vessels | control diameter, regulate blood flow | 
| lung airways | control diameter, regulate air flow | 
| GI tract | tone, motility, sphincters | 
| urinary system | propels urine through ureter, bladder tone, internal sphincter | 
| male reproductive tract | secretion, propels semen | 
| female reproductive tract | propulsion (fallopian tube), childbirth (uterine myometrium) | 
| eye | control of pupil diameter (iris muscle) and lens shape (ciliary muscle) | 
| kidney | glomerular regulation (mesangial cells) | 
| skin | hair erection (pili muscles) | 

## Smooth muscle structure
- no cross bridge pattern, hence smooth
- each smooth muscle cell is spindle shaped
    - 2-10 micrometer diameter
    - 50-400 micrometer length
- many smooth muscle cells are interconnected to form sheet-like layers
    - arranged in sheets to form muscle
- single nucleus
- able to proliferate
    - contolled by various paracrine growth factors
- not striated, but still rely on:
    - myosin (thick) filaments
    -  actin (thin) filaments
        -  anchored to plasma membrane or
        -  anchored to dense body
            -  dense body has similar function to Z line in skeletal muscle
    - **no troponin, myofibrils, or regular alignment (no sarcomeres)**
- a) skeletal muscle, b) cardiac muscle, c) smooth muscle

### Compare and contrast
|          | Skeletal muscle | Smooth muscle |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| under voluntary control | yes | no | 
| relative cell size | large | small | 
| nucleus | multinucleated | single nucleus | 
| ability to differentiate | minimal | maintained throughout life | 
| thick filaments | yes | yes | 
| thin filaments | yes | yes | 
| myofibrils | yes | no | 
| sarcomeres | yes | no | 
| calcium controls contractile activity | yes | yes | 

## Smooth muscle contraction
- many contractile signals compete to trigger contraction
    - these signals influence smooth muscle contractile activity by changing the concentration of calcium in the cytosol
    - some contractile signals increase contraction while others inhibit
- smooth muscle has no neuromuscular junctions
    - instead, smooth muscle has autonomic nerve fibres innervating them that branch on top of a sheet of muscle fibres
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/sj4gK9D.png =250x)
- change in membrane potential is **not always** required for contraction
- some smooth muscle cells respond to membrane depolarisation
    - **voltage gated Ca^2+^ influx (not sodium)**
    - propagates AP and causes contraction
    - graded contraction
        - fine tuned response
- some do not require membrane depolarisation (no change in membrane potential)
    - hormone/ligand induced mobilisation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca^2^

### Activating signals in smooth muscle leads to either:
1. increased cytosolic calcium concentration
2. altered sensitivity to the available calcium

### Contractile signals in smooth muscle
- **not** normally direct voluntary control (different to skeletal muscle)
1. **spontaneous electrical activity** in the muscle cell plasma membrane
    - peristalsis
2. **neurotransmitters** released by autonomic neurons (involuntary control)
    - sympahtetic (fight/flight)
    - parasympathetic (rest/digest)
3. **hormonal secretions**
    - local factors (e.g. changes in chemical conposition of the fluid around the cell)
4. **membrane stretch**

### Response to signals in smooth muscle is increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration
- calcium moves into the cytosol:
    1. across the plasma membrane from the extracellular space
    2. released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)

#### Channels involved
- **calcium moves across the plasma membrane into cells via:**
    - L-type **voltage-gated** channels
    - **receptor-operated** calcium channels (ROCC)
- **calcium flows into the cytosol from the SR via:**
    - **calcium-induced-calcium release (CICR)** channels: opened by calcium
    - **IP~3~-mediated calcium release:** IP~3~-gated channels open when IP~3~ levels in the cytosol rise

#### How calcium enters cytoplasm
1. voltage-gated channels
2. ligand-gated channels
    - activated by neurotransmitter/hormone
3. second messenger induced calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)
    - IP~3~
    - Ca^2+^

## Smooth muscle activating signals
- mechanisms to increase intracellular calcium in the smooth muscle 
- increased intracellular calcium = contraction
![](https://i.imgur.com/3K7Zt8v.png =350x)

### 1. Spontaneous electrical activity - pacemaker
- spontaneous action potential in absence of neural or hormonal input
- the membrane potential change occurring during the psonteaneous depolarization to threshold is known as pacemaker potential
- membrane depolarization (propagation of the action potential along the muscle plasma membrane) is propagated by inward movement of calcium
- some smooth muscle cells have an inbuilt "oscillator" in their membranes or inside the cells
- in some muscles are specialized pacemaker cells

#### Example: conctraction in the uterus - pacemaker potential of smooth muscle cell membrane (mechanism A: membrane oscillator)
- membrane oscillator: coordinated series of ion pumps and channels in action, always active in the cell
    - exact nature of pumps not fully understood
- the action of this oscillator i.e. movement of ions in and out that is of sufficient potential difference to activate the voltage-gated calcium channels in the membrane
- calcium can flow into the cell from outside across the plasma membrane via these channels

#### Example: contraction in the vascular smooth muscle and airways - pacemaker potential of smooth muscle cell membrane (mechanism B: cytoplasm oscillator)
- cytoplasm oscillator: is triggered by receptor induced entry of calcium
- more cytosolic calcium triggers release of calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum
- can also trigger opening of voltage-gated calcium channels

#### Example: contraction in gastrointestinal tract - pacemaker potential of smooth muscle cell membrane (mechanism C)
- interstitial cells of cajal (ICC): pacemaker cells in the intestine
    - have their own cytosolic calcium oscillator
    - the ICC have slow waves of membrane depolarization
- these changes in voltage pass from the ICC to the smooth muscle cells via the gap junctions

### 2. Innervation of smooth muscle: nerves/neurotransmitter
- regulation depends on 
    - type of innervation
    - proximity of neuron to muscle cell
    - type of neurotransmitter
    - distribution of nuerotransmitter receptors
- innervation generally autonomic
    - arteries generally sympathetic
    - other tissues both symp- and para-sympathetic

#### Nerves/hormones
- varicosities: contains many vesicles filled with neurotransmitters
- neurotransmitters are released due to an AP in the nerve
- varicosities from one axon can be located along several muscle cells
- one single muscle cell can be located near varicosities of both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves

### 3. Hormonal secretions
- factors released into the local environment control smooth muscle cell contraction
- one important example is nitric oxide (next lecture)

### 4. membrane stretch
- stretching of membrane can open mechanically-gated ion channels
- this is a reported mechanism in vascular smooth muscle cells
- membrane depolarisation can occur
- this triggers opening of voltage-gated calcium channels

## Types of smooth muscle units
- single unit (phasic)
- multi-unit (tonic)

### Single unit (phasic)
- intentinal tract, uterus, small blood vessels
- synchronous activity (electrical and mechanical): all cells function as one unit
- **gap junctions**
- may include pacemaker cels to initiate AP
![](https://i.imgur.com/Eag3P4C.png =250x)![](https://i.imgur.com/cEzbOcz.png =120x)

### Multi-unit (tonic)
- large airways/arteries, hair attachments
- no or few gap junctions
- richly innervated
- don't usually propagate action potentials
- instead use other mechanisms such as circulating hormones to mediate concraction

## Summary: smooth muscle contraction excitation/contraction coupling
- driven by changes in cytosolic Ca^2+^ 
    - sarcoplasmic reticulum
        - less significant than in skeletal muscle
        - less structured - no need for speed/distribution
        - no T tubules but overlap with plasma membrane
        - activated by action potential or **second messengers**
    - plasma membrane Ca^2+^ channels
        - voltage and ligand-gated Ca^2+^ channels
        - 10,000 fold concentration gradient
        - small cell therefore easy diffusion
- relative contribution varies

### Control of calcium more delicate in smooth muscle
- **ligand-gated** channels (receptor operated calcium channels e.g. sensitive to ATP, noradrenaline, acetylcholine)
    - activated by neurotransmitter/hormone
- **voltage gated** channels (L-type calcium channels, similar ot DHP)
    - activated by action potential
- **second messenger induced calcium release** from sarcoplasmic reticulum
    - activated by IP~3~ (IP~3~-gated channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum)
    - activated by calcium (calcium-induced-calcium release channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum)

#### Mechanisms of calcium release
- smooth muscles have areas similar to motor end plants called calveolus
    - the calveolus have areas of concentration of **ligand and hormone** receptors (**2 in diagram**)
- there are also **voltage-gated calcium channels** (L-type channel, similar to DHP in the T-tubule of skeletal muscle, **1 in diagram**)
    - these can open due to change in voltage and allow influx of calcium
- smooth muscle: release of calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum
    - calcium-induced-calcium release channels (CICR)
        - opened by increased calcium in cytosol
    - IP~3~-gated calcium channel
        - opened by binding of IP~3~
