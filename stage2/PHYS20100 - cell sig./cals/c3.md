## Hierarchy panel exercises
Working on the hierarchy panel, click on the plus sign of the "Signaling by GPCR" →	"GPCR downstream signal" and answer these questions:
1. How many G-alpha are shown?
Five types of G-alpha are shown, G-alpha-12, G-alpha-s, G-alpha-z, G-alpha-i, and G-alpha-q.

2. Which G-alpha did we see in lectures?
G-alpha-q, G-alpha-i, G-alpha-s in [Lesson 19_21 GPCRs](https://brightspace.ucd.ie/d2l/le/content/157606/viewContent/1681508/View).

3. Can you identify second messengers in the cartoon?
- Second messengers (molecules/ions relaying that relay the signal) include: 
    - in G-alpha (12/13) signaling events:
        - G-alpha-12, RHO GEFs
    - in G-alpha (s) signaling events:
        - G-alpha-s, AC, cAMP
    - in G-alpha (z) signaling events:
        - G-alpha-z, AC, cAMP
    - in G-alpha (i) signaling events:
        - G-alpha-i, AC, cAMP
        - G-beta, G-gamma, PLCB, IP3
    - in G-alpha (q) signaling events:
        - G-alpha-q, PLCB, IP3

## Diagram window
1. Go to the cell-cell communication graph and get a cartoon of the cellular junctions from the larger window. Download and include in the report.

Working with this scheme:
1. Can you name the junctions that may mediate juxtracrine communication?
Tight, adherens, and gap junctions mediate juxtacrine communication. Juxtacrine signalling occurs when the chemical messenger is found in the cell membrane, which interacts with another cell by them joining together via the membrane-bound messenger.
2. Can you name the junctions that are important for smooth muscle coordination?
In single unit (phasic) smooth muscles, gap junctions are important in contraction. In multi unit (tonic) smooth muscles, there are no to few gap junctions that may be involved in contraction. However, other mechanisms such as circulating hormones play a relatively bigger role in mediating contraction for this type of smooth muscle. 

3. Come back to the general scheme and look for the “protein localization” graph and download the cartoon associated with this category. Explore it and name:

    - The two protein complexes shown for the mitochondria
        1. TOMM40 complex.
        2. TIMM23 complex.
    - Proteins associated with an organelle responsible for protein PTMs (post-translational modifications).
        - An organelle responsible for protein post-translational modifications is the endoplasmic reticulum. 
        - Here we see tail-anchored (TA) proteins associated with this organelle.
    - Proteins in the membrane of the peroxisome.
        1. PEX 19.
        2. PEX 3.

## Search tool, description (lower) window
1. What is the name of the tool you are redirected and what is it about?
    - Redirects to [IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=4726).
    - Page provides information about the drug including: naming (IUPAC, international nonproprietary, common, etc.), classification, and database links. 
    - Page has subpages covering: summary (with details mentioned previously), biological activity, clinical data, references, structure, similar ligands, and (un)labelled forms.
3. Get a screenshot of the 2D structure of this drug.

5. Find the molecular target of this drug.
    - The molecular target of digoxin is: the Na-K-ATPase pump. 
    - It inhibits the Na-K-ATPase pump in order to increase intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations, which overall increases muscle contractility (it promotes actin and myosin contractile proteins).
7. Coming back to Reactome can you find the clinical data information for the drug vericiguat using the same associated tool as in Q3.1. 
    - Vericiquat on [IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=10010).

## CRN 20873-specific questions
1. Identify a disorder on the “ion channels related to ABC transporter” (TIP Ireland has the highest incidence  in the world).
    - Cystic fibrosis (caused by defective CFTR).
2. Identify the drugs that are related to this disease and find in the scheme their target.
    - Ivacaftor on [IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=4342).
    - Ivacaftor binds defective CFTR.

4. Can you find and name the mutants for this receptor?
    - CFTR G551D: has L-aspartic acid instead of glycine 551 due to mutation. 
6. Find the diseases related to carbohydrate metabolism and download the image.
