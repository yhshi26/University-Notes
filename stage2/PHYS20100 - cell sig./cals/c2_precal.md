## Muscle
> The human body has 3 main types of cells that are highly differentiated to function almost exclusively in muscle contraction. The objectives of the following Computer Aided Learning (CAL) exercise are:

- to identify skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle
- to identify the intracellular structures of these muscle types
- to understand the role played by myofibrils in skeletal muscle contraction
- to understand motor nueron skeletal muscle fibre junctions

### Structure: components of skeletal muscle
- muscle fiber = muscle cell = myocyte
- prefixes: sarco = flesh/meat, myo = muscle, epi = above, peri = around
- macro to micro: fascia → fascicle/fasciculus → fibre → filament
- fibrous connective tissue: epimysium encloses entire muscle, perimysium bundles muscle fibres together into fascicles, endomysium surrounds each muscle fibre (cell)

#### Skeletal-muscle fiber filaments

#### Sliding filament model of contraction
- thick/thin filaments in the sarcomere
    - thick filaments: about 110 angstroms diameter (1x10^-10^m)
    - thin filaments: about 50-60 angstroms diameter

- sliding of thick filaments past overlapping thin filaments

### Smooth muscle
- characterised by lack of sarcomeres
    - gives skeletal and cardiac muscle characteristic striated pattern
- has some loosely arranged interconnected contractile apparatus, which uses the sliding filament/cross bridge mechanism of contraction

#### Structure: smooth muscle fibers
- spindle-shaped
- lack striations
- single nucleus
- capable of cell division
- contain actin and myosin filaments
- contract by sliding-filament mechanism

#### Location: smooth muscle
- mainly found on lining of hollow visceral organs
- depending on orientation of smooth muscle cells, they can be circular (axis circular with tract) or longitudinal (axis longitudinal with tract)
    - circular only: blood vessels and bronchioles
    - circular and longitudinal: gi tract, ureters (urine transport) and uterus (ova)
- peristaltic movement: a combination of circular and longitudinal smooth muscle causes persitaltic waves in the intestine, which propels contents in one direction
    - circular muscle contracts behind bolus and relaxes in front of it
    - longitudinal muscle contracts, shortening disttance for next wave

#### Single-unit smooth muscle: behaves as a single unit
**Features:**
1. numerous gap junctions between cells - electronically linked for synchronous contraction
2. display intrinsic pacemaker activity (action potentials from within)
3. contract in response to stretch
4. poorly innervated by autonomic nerves, which modulate rather than initiate contraction
5. associated with visceral organs e.g. intestine, gut

#### Multi-unit smooth muscle: requires nerve stimulation
**Features:**
1. few if any gap junctions
2. cells stimulated individually by nerve fibres
3. highly innervated by autonomic nerves
4. mingled with connective tissue
5. e.g. arrector pili muscles in skin; ciliary muscles in eye

### Innervation and stimulation of smooth muscles (vs skeletal muscles)
**Skeletal muscle cell:**
- somatic nervous system (voluntary control)
- has only one nerve-muscle junction - the neuromuscular junction
- has T-tubules and extensive sarcoplasmic reticulum
- ACh receptors confined to neuromuscular junction
- ACh receptor: nicotinic (Na^+^ ion channel)
- ACh initiates excitation-contraction via Na^+^-mediated action potentials
**Smooth muscle cell:**
- autonomic nervous system (involuntary control)
- no neuromuscular junciton, just varicosities where ACh is released near smooth muscle cell
- has no T-tubules and little sarcoplasmic reticulum
- entire surface of smooth muscle cell has receptors
- parasympathetic innervation: ACh → muscarinic ACh receptor (G-protein coupled)
- sympathetic innervation: noradrenaline → adrenergic receptor
> note: only multi-unit smooth muscle cells receive both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation
