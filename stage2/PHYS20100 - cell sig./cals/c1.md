### SDL question 1
A) A: nucleus, B: cytoplasm/cytosol, C: plasma membrane
B) the nucleus is usually the largest subcellular organelle
C) a lipid bilayer confers selective permeability on the plasma membrane (substances can't cross it indiscriminately - including charged/polar or large molecules)

### SDL question 2
A) A: nucleolus, B: nuclear pore
B) nuclear pore width approximately 120nm
C) the nucleolus produces ribosomes, and rapidly proliferating cells require more ribosomes

### SDL question 3
A) A: smooth endoplasmic reticulum, B: mitochondria
B) smooth endoplasmic reticulum synthesizes lipids, steroids, and phospholipids
C) smooth endoplasmic reticulum metabolizes carbohydrates

### SDL question 4
A) A: mitochondria
B) some of the mitochondria appear elongated while others appear circular as they are displayed on different planes/sections
C) muscle cells contain a lot of mitochondria, as they require atp synthesis and mitochondria is the site of cellular respiration
D) mitochondria contain their own dna due to the [endosymbiotic theory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3428767/) 

### SDL question 5
A) A: lysosome, B: nucleoplasm
B) lysosomes degrade and recycle cellular waste
C) phagolysosome: lysosome fused with a phagosome

### SDL question 6
A) A: ribosomes on rough endoplasmic reticulum, B: mitochondria
B) the principal function of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is protein synthesis
C) post-translational modification refers to various processes one or more amino acids undergo as part of a protein after translation 

### SDL question 7
A) A: golgi apparatus
B) the golgi apparatus works to process and package proteins and lipids for transport within and out a cell
C) a secretory vacuole is also termed a [condensing vacuole](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095631217#:~:text=A%20membrane%2Dbounded%20secretory%20vesicle,precursors%2C%20as%20in%20zymogen%20granules.)

### SDL question 8
A) A: secretory vacuoles, B: plasma membrane, C: exocytosis, D: extracellular matrix, E: glycocalyx
B) [exocytosis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8822150/#:~:text=Exocytosis%20is%20the%20fusion%20of,lipids%20into%20the%20plasma%20membrane.&text=Regulated%20exocytosis%20varies%20greatly%20in%20kinetics%20and%20Ca2%2B%20dependency%20between%20cell%20types.) is the release of vesicle content into the extracellular space and the incorporation of new proteins and lipids into the plasma membrane

### SDL question 9
A) A: microtubules, B: microfilaments, C: plasma membrane
B) microtubules, along with microfilaments and intermediate filaments form the cytoskeleton which provides structure, support, resistance to tearing, motility, scaffolding, and assistance in mitosis (cytokinesis)
C) many [anti-cancer drugs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3946048/) target the formation of microtubules as, without their support in scaffolding, cell proliferation will be slowed down (mitosis, cytokinesis)
D) the main protein components of microfilaments are fibrous actin (F-actin) and globular actin (G-actin)

### SDL question 10
A) cross-section of cilia
B) A: axoneme, B: 9 peripheral doublets arranged laterally, C: dynein arms
C) while cilia and flagella are essentially the same, ciliated cells have many short cilia, while flagellated cells have only a few flagella for movement [more](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21698/#:~:text=Although%20cilia%20and%20flagella%20are,cells%20have%20many%20short%20cilia.&text=In%20mammals%2C%20many%20epithelial%20cells,materials%20across%20the%20tissue%20surface.)

### SDL question 11
A) A: lipid droplets, B: glycogen granules, C: mitochondria, D: rough endoplasmic reticulum
B) lipid droplets are more abundant in [adipose cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_droplet)
C) [hepatic/liver cells](https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/glycogen.htm) are more abundance in glycogen granules

### SDL question 12
A) A: collagen fibres, B: jell-like ground substance
B) collagen is synthesized in fibroblasts ([collagen synthesis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507709/#:~:text=Collagen%20is%20composed%20of%203,to%20form%20a%20triple%20helix.&text=The%20process%20of%20collagen%20synthesis,occurs%20both%20intracellularly%20and%20extracellularly.))
C) large amounts of collagen fibres are found in epithelial tissue

### SDL question 13
A) this individual is a male (Y chromosome present)
B) [kleinfelters syndrome](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/klinefelters-syndrome/#:~:text=Klinefelter%20syndrome%20(sometimes%20called%20Klinefelter's,genetic%20sex%20of%20a%20baby.) is a condition where a male is born with an extra X chromosome
C) an extra chromosome 21 is associated with down-syndrome
