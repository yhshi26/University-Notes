> learning objectives: consider some of the control mechanisms for limiting physiological responses (1. membrane polarisation, 2. modulation of receptors, 3. modulation of signalling cascades, 4. deregulation in disease)

## Controlling cell signalling
- so far we have focussed on driving events forward
    - receptor activation (duration of the signal/concentration signal and receptor)
    - amplification
    - switching on: GTP/Phosphorylation
    - integration/crosstalk
- to maintain equilibrium there is generally an inhibitory event for every activating event; principle of **reflex organisation**

### 1. Neuronal signalling
- inhibit cell body activation
    - inhibitory inputs
    - maintain polarised state
    - inhibit action potential generation
- inhibit neurotransmitter release
    - as above
- reduce neurotransmitter duration of activity
    - e.g. acetylcholinesterase at NMJ

#### Inhibition of input by inhibitory receptors in soma

#### Inhibition of input by decreasing concentration of calcium ions or neurotransmitters

### 2. Controlling cellular responses to soluble mediators: regulation of signal at the level of receptors
- up-regulate cell surface exrpression of recepto
- down-regulate cell surface receptor
- reduce affinity for ligand
    - allosteric modulation
- produce endogenous receptor antagonist
    - IL-1 receptor antagonist
- compete for ligand with decoy receptor
    - soluble TNF receptor

#### Receptor internalisation
- reduce concentration of receptors
- remove receptor and signal by endocytosis, bringing them into the cell to be degraded by lysosomes

#### Allosteric regulation
- there is a threshold effect
- activating receptor
- decoy receptors
- inhibitor receptor (regulated by antagonist) for allosteric modulation

- all receptors can be allosterically modulated

#### Regulation of monomeric G-protein signalling
- G-proteins use the GTP/GDP cycle as a molecular switch for signal transduction

#### GPCRs
- GTP bound alpha unit active
    - GTP hydrolysed to GDP plus pi
    - facilitated by RGS family (regulator or G protein signalling)
- hormone bound GPCR increases phosphorylation activity of GPCR-kinases
    - phosphorylation recruits beta-arrestins
    - andocytosis
    - cell desensitised to hormone

### 3. Regulation of signal by controlling 2nd messenger with protein phosphatases and phosphodiesterases
- 2 ways to terminate cAMP and cGMP signalling
    - enhanced degradation of cyclic nucleotide
        - phosphodiesterase
        - cAMP to AMP
        - cGMP to GMP
    - de-phosphorylation of effector proteins
        - protein phosphatase
- example: smooth muscle

- PDE inhibitors

#### Ligand-dependent vs. ligand-independent

## Normal function requires balance
- we balance the sympathetic with the parasympathetic
- for every vasoconstrictor there is a vasodilator
- etc, etc
