## Why do we need cell-cell signalling?
- control of muscle function
    - smooth muscle
    - skeletal muscle
- control of organ function
    - heart, gut, liver, kidney, lungs...
- control of hormone secretion
    - pituitary, adrenal, pancreas, etc.
- maintenance of organ structure
    - connective tissue, epithelial/endothelial integrity

### Evolution?
- we have evolved to take advantage of physical and chemical characteristics of the building blocks from which we are composed:
    - electrical communication
    - neuronal signalling
    - soluble signalling molecules
    - ability to communicate is key to development of symbiotic relationship
        - communication central to multicellular organisms, but also present in unicellular organisms

### Categories of chemical messengers
- endocrine, neurocrine, paracrine, autocrine
- a given chemical messenger can fit into more than one category; for example, the steroid hormone cortisol affects the very cells in which it is made, the nearby cells that produce other hormones, and many distant targets including muscles and the liver

#### Intercellular chemical messengers
- **hormones** are produced in and secreted from endocrine glands or in scattered cells that are distributed throughout another organ, but all hormones travel through blood to their target cells
- **neurotransmitters** are chemical messengers that are released from the endings of neurons onto other neurons, muscle cells, or gland cells; **they can be part of paracrine signals, but by convention they are not**

#### Other types of cell communication
- there are important types of chemical communication between cells that do not require secretion of a chemical messenger
- **gap junctions** are physical linkages connecting the cytosol between two cells, which allow molecules to move from one cell to an adjacent cell without entering the extracellular fluid (electrical synapses)
- **juxtacrine signalling** is the chemical messenger not actually being released from the cell producing it, but rather is located in the plasma membrane of that cell; when the cell encounters another cell type capable of responding to the message, the two cells link up via the membrane-bound messenger

### Cell signalling classification based on distance: local and long distance

| Local | Long distance | 
| ----- | ------------- |
| contact: gap junctions, adhesion junctions | endocrine: e.g. insulin, adrenalin | 
| cell-cell signalling: paracrine (e.g. histamine), autocrine (e.g. VEGF, IL-1), synaptic (e.g. ACh, NAd) | neuronal: electric impulse | 

### Cell signalling classification based on origin of the signal

## General cell signalling
- **signalling molecule (ligand)** (red)
    - protein/peptide
    - hormone
    - neurotransmitter
    - nucleotide
    - lipid
    - gases
    - ions
- **receptor** (light green)
    - membrane-bound
    - or intracellular (steroid hormone)
- **signal transduction pathway** (dark green)
    - amplification/second messengers
- **cellular response** (orange)
    - contract
    - live/die
    - differentiate

### Factors that affect outcome of signal
- half-life of signalling molecule
- distribution of signal
- type of receptors
    - cell surface receptors
        - most ligands have multiple receptor subtypes with tissue specific expression
            - e.g. Ach receptors of skeletal muscle and heart
            - e.g. histamine receptors of respiratory system or stomach
        - endogenous vs exogenous ligands
            - e.g. opiod receptors (endorphinds/heroin)
            - e.g. nicotinic receptors (ACh or nicotine)
            - e.g. GABA receptors (GABA or barbituates)
- specificity of receptor for signal
    - not all cells express the same receptors
    - this selective expression leads to specificity of the systems
    - the response of individual cells with the same receptor also vary based on cell type, intracellular signalling cascade coupling, and other simultaneous signals being received
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/69pLgNS.png =250x)
- number of receptors activated
- type of intracellular signalling molecules recruited

#### Cell commmunication example
- e.g. development, solid tumours in cancer

#### Long distance signalling-insulin hormone
- food causes incerase in blood glucose
- causes release of insulin from pancrase
    - islets of langerhaans
- insulin travels in theblood to stimulate glucose uptake into muscle, liver, fat cells

#### Regulation of cell growth

## Summary
- cell communication is essential for survival of multi-cellular organisms
- short distance signalling
    - synaptic
    - autocrine
    - paracrine
- long distance signalling
    - neuronal
    - endocrine

### Chemical messenger points of emphasis
- a neuron, endocrine gand cell, and other cell types may all secrete the same chemical messenger
- in some cases, a particular messenger may function as a neurotransmitter, a hormone, or a paracrine or autocrine substance
- norepinephrine, for example, is not only a neurotransmitter in the brain; it is also produced as a hormone by cells of the adrenal glands

#### Hormones and glands can be reflex components
- almost all body cells can act as effectors in homeostatic reflexes
- muscles and glands, however, are the major effectors of biological control systems
- glands may be both a receptor and an integrating center, and they secrete hormones into th eblood that act as effectors
- a **hormone** is a type of chemical messenger secreted into the blood by cells of the endocrine system; hormones may act on many different cells simultaneously because they circulate throughout the body
