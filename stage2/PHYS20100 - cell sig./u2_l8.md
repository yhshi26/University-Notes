> learning objectives: membrane potential also important in non-excitable cells, describe 3 situations where membrane potentials contribute to cell function: 1: action potentials in excitable tissues (a: neuronal signalling, b: muscle contraction); 2: mitochondria function; 3: regulation of insulin secretion

### Graded potentials 
- can be excitatory or inhibitory
- neuronal signalling
    - **sensory receptors**
    - **neuronal synapses/NMJ**
        - nicotinic Ach receptor
        - many other neurotransmitters
            - GABA, glutamate, serotonin
        - purinoceptors (ATP)
- graded potentials can activate local voltage-gated ion channels 
    - AP
- important in regulating voltage-gated channels in other tissues
    - e.g. voltage-gated calcium channels

### Excitable tissues
- excitable cell
    - ability to generate and transmit an electrical signal (action potential)
- excitable tissues
    - regions of the body that contribute to transmission of electrical 
    1. sensory receptors
    2. neuron cell bodies
    3. axons
    4. muscles
    
### Sensory receptors

#### Example: touch

## Excitable tissues
- how does the electrical signal arise?
    - graded potentials in sensory receptor of afferent neuron
        - receptor potentials
    - graded potentials incell body of efferent neuron
        - IPSPs and EPSPs (ACh activated ion channel)
- how does it travel through a cell?
- how does it trigger responses?

## Non-excitable electrical communication
- local communication within the cell due to changes in membrane potential
    - secretion
    - cell proliferation
    - cellular differentiation
- important in normal physiology
- crucial for mitochondrial function
- important in tissue responses to injury
    - vascular remodelling
- **classic example glucose-induced insulin secretion**

## Mitochondria
### Mitochondrial membrane potential key in oxidative phosphorylation
- diagram: mitochondria
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/vcq2XEN.png =250x)
- diagram: oxidative phosphorylation
    - energy transferred to ATP when hydrogen ions are combiend wtih molecular oxygen to form water
    - electrons are passed down the proteins of the electron transport chain; as the electrons are moveed it generates some energy that can power the cytochromes to pump hydrogen ions into the intermembrane space
        - this creates a concentration gradient (more hydrogen ions in the intermembrane space) which is a source of potential difference across the inner mitochondrial membrane as these ions are pumped out
    - the ATP synthase in the inner membrane forms a channel and hydrogen can flow back into the matrix side; the energy transfer catalyzes the formation of ATP

## Insulin secretion
### Diabetes
- type I (insulin dependent)
- type II (adult onset)
    - often associated with poor diet
    - decreased sensitivity for insulin
    - decreased insulin secretion

#### Insulin
- insulin is secreted by the pancreatic beta cell
- it is the only hormone capable of lowering the blood glucose concentration
- the beta cell is a glucose sensor
- the beta cell functions to metabolically induce changes in the electrical activity that lead to:
    - increased cytoplasmic calcium concentration
    - initiation of calcium-dependent release of insulin containing granules

##### Pancreatic beta-cell at rest
- whilst fasting, pancreatic beta-cell is at rest (low glucose)
    - ATP-sensitive potassium channel is open
    - potassium moves out (against concentration gradient created by sodium-potassium-ATPase)
    - RMP ~= -70mV close to that for potassium
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/nntkn5Y.png =250x)
    
##### Pancreatic beta-cell upon glucose ingestion
- glucose taken up by the glut 2 transporter
- glucose breakdown generates ATP
![](https://i.imgur.com/0aahv0S.png =250x)
- ATP binds to ATP-sensitive potassium channels and they close
    - potassium accumulates in the beta cell
    - this increase in positive ions inside the cell causes membrane depolarisation (graded depolarisation)
- graded potential triggers the opening of the voltage-gated calcium channel
    - calcium flows into the cell
    - calcium triggers the release of insulin-containing granules from the beta cells

##### Pancreatic beta-cell returned to rest
- insulin released from pancreas travels in blood to promote glucose uptake
- therefore glucose uptake in the beta-cell is reduced
- leads to opening of the potassium channels again
- feedback regulation by insulin

#### Treatment of type II diabetes
- increase insulin secretion
- block potassium channels using sulphonylureas
    - glibenclamide
    - gliburide
- increase insulin sensitivity
    - PPARgamma gaonist (thiazolidinedione)
        - rosiglitazone, pioglitazone
        
## Summary
- electrical communication
    - depolarisation/hyperpolarisation of cell membrane
    - change in membrane potential
        - graded potential triggering action potential
- crucial influence on cell function outside excitable tissues
    - e.g. insulin secretion

## Summary (understand these concepts)
- know how resting membrane potential is formed
- be able to describe how an action potential in an axon is generated
- how excitation-contraction coupling works
- steps in sliding filament mechanism
- why skeletal muscle is striated
- what different signals trigger smooth muscle
- how calcium enters smooth muscle cells
- how MLCK and MLCP work in smooth muscle
- how excitation works outside of nerves and muscle
