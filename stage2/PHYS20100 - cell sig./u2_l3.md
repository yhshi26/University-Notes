## How nerve signaling induces muscle contraction
### Connection of nerve with muscle
- neurons that innervate (travel to) the skeletal muscle = motor neurons (these cause activity/movement)
- the axon forms many branches once it reaches the muscle (and these branches wrap around it)

### Muscle microstructure

- thick and thin filaments → sarcomeres → myofibrils → muscle fibers (single muscle cells)

#### The motor unit
- a single motor unit consists of a motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it controls (it controls multiple muscle fibers)
- each muscle fiber is controlled by a branch from only one neuron

### Sequence of events in muscle contraction
Muscle contraction = signaling event → contraction
**signaling: neuromuscular junction**
- nerve action potential → change membrane potential in muscle fiber
**contraction: excitation-contraction coupling and sliding filament mechanism**
- increases calcium in the muscle fiber → causes sliding of thick and thin filaments

## Neuromuscular junctions
- the junction (synapse) of the axon terminal with a muscle fiber 
- is a specialist chemical synapse where neuronal action potentials are chemically transmitted across the synaptic cleft to activate the muscle fiber

### Structure
- motor neuron axon terminal (bouton)
    - rich in acetylcholine (ACh) filled vesicles
- motor end plate
    - region of muscle fiber plasma membrane that lies directly under the terminal portion of motor neuron axon terminal
    - contains ACh receptors
        - ligand-gated ion channels

#### Acetylcholine (ACh)
- major neurotransmitter in peripheral nervous system (NMJ) and brain
- made from choline and acetyl coenzyme A in the cytoplasm of synaptic terminals
- upon release binds ACh receptors or is broken down by acetylcholinesterase

#### ACh receptors
- nicotinic
    - ligand-gated ion channel
    - permeable to both Na^+^ and K^+^
    - important in NMJ and certain regions of brain

### ACh function, major steps in process
- the neuromuscular junction is the point of synaptic contact between the axon terminal of a motor neuron and the muscle fiber it controls
- action potentials in the motor neuron cause acetylcholine release into the neuromuscular junction
- muscle contraction follows the delivery of acetylcholine to the muscle fiber

### Steps with diagram
![](https://i.imgur.com/TySX3rh.png =350x)
1. action potential arrives at axon terminal
2. membrane depolarization leads to opening of voltage-gated calcium channels and calcium entry into the axon terminal
3. leads to fusion of ACh containing vesicles and ACh release into synaptic cleft
4. ACh finds nicotinic receptors and binds
5. ligand-gated ion channel opens allowing Na^+^ entry, causing a graded depolarization
7. 7) the graded depolarization typically exceeds threshold for nearby voltage-gate Na^+^ and K^+^ channels, so an action potential occurs in the muscle fiber
9. 9) acetylcholinesterase enzyme breaks down ACh, when ACh no longer bound to receptors in ion channels in the muscle fiber close and the membrane returns to resting potential
