### Sequence of events in muscle contraction
Muscle contraction = signaling event → contraction 
Signaling: neuromuscular junction
- nerve action potential → change membrane potential in muscle 
Fiber contraction: excitation-contraction coupling and sliding filament mechanism
- increases calcium in the muscle fiber → causes sliding of thick and thin filaments

## Skeletal muscle as a tissue

## Muscle fibres (microscopy)
- multiple muscle fibres bound together by connective tissue in a striated banding pattern

### Muscle fibres are composed of myofibrils
- myofibrils (1-2 microM cylinders) composed of:
    - thick and thin filaments arranged in bundle
- sarcoplasmic reticulum
- transverse (T) tubules

#### Skeletal muscle fibres
- multinucleated cell formed by fusion of multiple myoblasts during development
- 10-100mM diamter
- up to 20cm in length
- limited capacity to regenerate from satellite cells
- compensation predominantly occurs via muscle cell hypertrophy (increase in size)

#### Myofibrils are composed of thick and thin filaments
- thick and thin filaments arranged in bundle to form myofibrils
    - thick filaments: polymer of myosin molecules
        - the globular heads of myosin (cross-bridges) extend out of the filament to make contact with the thin filament (cross-bridges can bind ATP and actin)
        - they also bind to ATp which is its energy force
    - thin filaments; mianly composed of actin
        - troponin and tropomyosin have important functions in contraction
- the contact between the thick and thin filament makes force

### Sarcomeres
- 1 unit of repeating thick and thin filaments arranged in parallel pattern
- thin filaments anchored to protein network called Z line on one end, other end overlaps part of thick filament

- A band = thick filaments in middle
    - cross-section through A band shows twice as many thin as thick filaments
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/dsUKAzg.png =250x)
- I band = contain parts of thin filaments not overlapping thick filament
- H zone = light narrow band in middle, space between thin filaments
- M line = narrow dark band in centre of H zone
    - H zone = proteins that link together the central regions of thick filaments

### Sarcoplasmic reticulum
- sleeve-like structure around myofibril
- enlarged region called terminal cisternae/lateral sacs: store calcium

### Transverse (T) tubules
- surround myofibrils
- continuous with plasma membrane
- allow action potential to propagate

## Sliding filament mechanism
- definition: when overlapping thick and thin filaments in each sarcomere move past each other
    - how: occurs through the movement of cross-bridges
    - calcium is critical

### Mechanism of sliding filament
- myosin's cross-bridges in the thick filament bind to actin in the thin filament
- the cross-bridges then flex to slide actin

#### Relaxation
- tropomyosin blocks the cross-bridge binding site on actin
![](https://i.imgur.com/y8dlq12.png =250x)

#### Contraction
- calcium ions bind to troponin
- this complex then pulls tropomyosin away from the cross-bridge binding site
![](https://i.imgur.com/vABg3FN.png =250x)
- **shortening:**
    - myosin binds to actin and slides it, pulling the Z-lines closer together, reducing the width of the I-bands (note: filament lengths have no changed)

#### The cross-bridge cycle
- the sequence of events between the time a cross-bridge binds to a thin filament, moves, and is set to repeat
- **4 steps in cycle:**
    ##### 1. attachment: of the cross-bridge to the thin filament
    - ATP hydrolysis (splitting) results in cross-bridge in resting muscle fibre to be in an energized state
        - hydrolysis products of ATP are ADP and inorganic phosphate - bound to myosin 
        - the myosin-binding site on actin becomes available due to presence of high concentration of calcium removing tropomyosin from actin so the energized myosin cross-bridge binds (note: in diagram, bound elements separated by a dot, detached elements separated by plus sign)
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/Wku7bGZ.png =300x)
    ##### 2. movement: of the cross-bridge, producing tension in the thin filament
    - departure of ADP + P~i~ causes the flexing of the bound cross-rbidge; sometimes called the power stroke

    ##### 3. detachment: of the cross-bridge from the thin filament
    - binding of a new ATP to the cross-bridge uncouples the bridge
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/U4qhPZp.png =250x)
    ##### 4. energizing: the cross-bridge so it can again attach to a thin filament to repeat the cycle
    - hydrolysis of the bound ATP (by myosin-ATPase): re-energises myosin

#### The cross-bridge cycle: summary

#### Summary
- skeletal muscle is striated
- thick and thin filaments make up the core structure of the muscle fibre/cell
- when thick and thin filaments bind they slide over each other causing shortening of the muscle fibre
