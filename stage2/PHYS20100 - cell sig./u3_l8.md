> learning objectives: develop an appreciation of what happens at the cellular level during ischemic injury (describe the role of HIF-1 in regulating gene expression, describe the paracrine regulation of angiogenesis, 2019 Nobel Prize: Semenza, Ratcliffe and Kaelin)

## Ischemia
- loss of blood supply
- caused by blockage or trauma in blood vessels
    - results in stroke
    - or myocardial infarction
- tissue downstream of blockage/damage becomes ischemic
    - low O2, high CO2 and lack of nutrients

### Resulting conditions 
#### Stroke
- blockage in blood vessels supplying brain
- brain tissue dies = stroke

#### Myocardial infarction
- blockage in blood vessels supplying heart by atheromas
- heart tissue becomes hypoxic
    - hypoxia = low oxygen in tissue

### Causes of ischemia
#### Pulmonary embolism
- coagulation occurs in the body (e.g. leg) 
- clot breaks down and is circulated to the lung, causing blockage of oxygen supply to blood 
- organism becomes hypoxemic
    - hypoxemia = low oxygen in blood

## Symptoms of ischemic tissue
- metabolically active cells are starved of oxygen
    - tissue becomes hypoxic
- tissue cannot get rid of CO2
- increased CO2 affects pH
- cells start to die
- complex signalling
    - injury, necrosis, inflammation
    - live cells attempt to cope.....

### Oxygen sensing
- hypoxia known to impact several signalling cascades
- classic adaptive responses to hypoxia dictated by the hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF-1
- active HIF-1 composed of two subunits
    - HIF-1 alpha
    - HIF-1 beta (also known as ARNT)

#### Adaptive response to hypoxia

#### Genes regulated by HIF-1 in hypoxia

#### Physiologic normoxia vs. hypoxia
- normoxia: appropriate supply of oxygen to tissues
    - 10% of oxygen allocated to degrading HIF-1a
    - 90% of oxygen allocated to metabolic processes
- hypoxia: not enough supply of oxygen to tissues
    - 100% of oxygen allocated to metabolic processes such that HIF-1a can accumulate

## Angiogenesis (blood vessel formation) response
#### VEGF is a critical mediator of angiogenesis
VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor

### Summary
- ischemia causes hypoxia
- hypoxia stabilises HIF-1a
- HIF-1 drives adaptation of cells
    - reduced metabolic activity
    - switch to anaerobic metabolism
- HIF-1 promotes secretion of pro-angiogenic factors like VEGF
- angiogenesis promotes new blood supply
- warning: Cancer
