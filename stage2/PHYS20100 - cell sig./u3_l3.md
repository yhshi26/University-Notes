###### tags: `PHYS20100 - cell sig.`

> reading: chapter 5 vander's
> leadning objectives: what is a g-protein coupled recptor, what type of endogenous ligands bind GPCRs, how are signals transduced by GPCRs, describe a physiological response mediated by a GPCR, describe a GPCR which is a therapeutic target, compare and contrast GPCR with other receptors (e.g. LGICs)

### Intracellular signaling
- first messenger (ligand)
- second messenger (signal)
- effector protein
- cell response

### Ligand-gated ion channels
- physiology
    - neurotransmission
    - muscle conctraction
    - insulin secretion
- pathophysiology
    - m. gravis
    - epilepsy
- pharmacology
    - tranquilizers muscle relaxants

### Receptor functions of proteins
- ligands can be classified in 2 groups:
    1. most chemical messengers are water-soluble and bind to receptors located at the plasma membrane
    2. a smaller number of messenger, like steroids, are lipid-soluble and bind to an intracellular receptor

### Cell surface receptors
- ion-channel-coupled receptors
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/eMwKAYv.png =200x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/a9JI5Di.png =350x)
- enzyme-coupled receptors

- G-protein-coupled receptors

## G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) structure
- over 700 in humans
- ligands include adrenaline, Ach, histamine, etc.
- targeted by around 50% of drugs
- single polypeptide chain 7 transmembrane regions
- highly evoluntionarily conserved

### Molecular switches
- molecules can be switched on and off
- post-translational modifications
- resolution of response equally important

#### Switching on G-proteins
- receptor: integral part
- G-protein peripheral protein
- ligand causes change in conformation
- receptor binds to G-protein
- regulation of G-protein subunits
![](https://i.imgur.com/El01Moo.png =225x)
- several different types of G-protein (receptor and target specific)
    - each composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits
- ligand binding decreases affinity for GDP so GTP binds in its place
- **may or may not be involved in subunit dissociation**
- **operates over a period of seconds**
- cholera toxin targets G-proteins (Gs subtype)
- pertussis toxin targets G-proteins

#### Switching off G-proteins
- always GDP in trimer
- alpha subunit has GTPase activity (off-switch)

## G-protein targets
### 1. Ion channels
- compare and contrast ACh receptors in skeletal
- muscle (ion channel) and in heart (GPCR)

### 2. Second messengers
- hydrophilic ligands the first messengers and cannot pass membrane
    - trigger modification of molecules in the cell (second messengers)
- second messengers are small molecules that can be produced or stored/released as a result of first messenger
- common properties:
    - can be synthesized/released and broken down again in specific reactions by **enzyme** or ion channels
    - some (e.g. Ca^2+^) can be stored in special **organelles** and quickly released when needed
    - their production/release and destruction can be **localized**, enabling the cell to limit space and time of signal activity

#### cAMP as a second messenger
- ligand
- G point activation
- activation of enyme
- second messenger
- activation pKa
- phosphorylation kinases

#### G~i~ protein-coupled receptors
- not all G-proteins stimulate cAMP; some **inhibit** adenylyl cyclase
- this occurs because these receptors are associated with different G-proteins known as G~i~ (i="inhibitory")
- activation of G~i~ causes the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase
    - this results in a decrease in cAMP concentration intracellularly
    - overall results in a decrease in the phosphorylation of key proteins intracellularly
