## How and why nerves trasmit signals
Nerves transmit signals in the following pathway: dendrites (incoming) → cell body → axon hillock → axon → axon terminals
**Convergence and divergence:** like a network grid (2 mechanisms)
- convergence involves multiple neurons coming together to produce an enhanced signal on a single neuron
- divergence involves a single neuron communicating its axon terminals with multiple neurons

**Outcome of nerve signalling:**
- communication
    - between neurons and rest of body
- response
    - sensing what's going on externally (peripherally)
    - communicating that back internally
    
### All cells have...
These following qualities result in a **resting (homeostatic) membrane potential (RMP)**:
- ion concentration gradients
- leak channels (passive diffusion)
- ion pumps (active diffusion)
    - e.g. Na^+^/K^+^ - ATPase

> inside is negative relative to outside

### Factors determining RMP
1. ion concentration
2. ion channels
3. ion pumps

### Excitable cells have...
- ion channels that open under certain conditions **(gated ion channels)**
    - e.g. due to change in voltage = voltage-gated ion channel
    - are used to generate electrical signals that transmit information between areas of a cell membrane = excitable membrane
    - these types of cells are excitable cells
        - e.g. nerves, muscles

## Electrical signals
- caused by transient (short term) changes in membrane potential
- essential for nerves to be able to process and trasmit signals
- electrical signal types:
    - graded potentials
        - short distance signalling
        - these feed into action potentials
    - action potentials
        - long distance signals of nerve and muscle membranes

### Schematic 
- demonstrates voltage at the membrane of neuron at rest (slightly negative charge on the inside relative to outside)
- in order for signalling to occur, need to change the resting membrane potential
    - requires a trigger
    - trigger changes flow of ions 
    - changing the flow/flux of ions changes concentrations → changes voltage difference to be more positive (due to more positive ions moving)
        - in an action potential, the positive change is so great it overshoots 0, resulting in repolarization to bring it down to normal
        - if repolarization undershoots, it is called hyperpolarizing bringing it below normal

## Graded potentials
- a small change (graded potential) that happens prior to a larger change (action potential) in a nerve
- occurs due to specific change in cell environment acting on a specialized region of a membrane 
    - e.g. chemical stimulus opening an ion channel
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/Q47ao1L.png =350x)

#### Graded potentials can depolarize or hyperpolarize
- A) depolarization or hyperpolarization can occur depending on the intiating signal
    - depolarization: influx of positive ions
    - hyperpolarization: influx of negative ions
- B) magnitude depends on magnitude of initiating signal
![](https://i.imgur.com/KlMoi5e.png =350x)

#### Change in membrane potential decreases as it moves away from site of initiation
- due to: 
    - ions moving in and out
    - open leak channels (mostly K^+^)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/RUbfMFT.png =325x)

### Graded potentials: summary
- potential change of varied magnitude, hence graded
- can be depolarising or hyperpolarising
- magnitude dependent on initiating event
- spread dependent on local membrane permeability
- currents usually die within a few mm
- important in short distance signalling
- crucial in triggering action potentials

## Action potentials
- definition: a brief all-or-none depolarization or repolarization of the membrane which reverses polarity in the neuron
- has a threshold (a voltage it must attain to continue transmitting electrical signal) and refactory period (a period during which it can't respond)
![](https://i.imgur.com/GgzgA7w.png =350x)

### Ion channels
- critical for generation, conduction, and propogation of an action potential: Na^+^ and K^+^

#### Gated ion channels
- **ligand-gated** (open in response to binding of molecules) *or* **mechanically-gated** (open in response to membrane stretch) trigger graded potentials that lead to action potentials
- **voltage-gated** (open in response to membrane depolarization) allow propogation of action potential
- Na^+^ and K^+^ crucial

#### Ion channels involved in generation and propogation of action potentials
![](https://i.imgur.com/5xORPCo.png =350x)
**initation:**
1. ligand-gated ion channel: ligand binding 
2. mechanically-gated ion channel: membrane stretch 
**propogation:**
3. voltage-gated Na^+^ channel: change in membrane potential 
**termination of an action potential:**
4. voltage-gated K^+^ channel: change in membrane potential
5. Na^+^/K^+^ ATPase
6. Na^+^ leak channel (not gated)
7. K^+^ leak channel (not gated)

#### Schematic: voltage-gated ion channels

### Steps in an action potential
![](https://i.imgur.com/FXzm3uU.png =350x)
1. steady resting membrane potential is near E~K~, P~K~ > P~Na~, due to leak K^+^ channels
2. local membrane is brought to threshold voltage by a depolarizing stimulus
3. current through opening voltage-gated Na^+^ channels rapidly depolarizes the membrane, causing more Na^+^ channels to open
4. inactivation of Na^+^ channels and delayed opening of voltage-gated K^+^ channels halt membrane depolarization
5. outward current through open voltage-gated K^+^ channels repolarize the membrane back to a negative potential
6. persistent current through slowly closing voltage-gated K^+^ channels hyperpolarizes membrane toward E~K~: Na^+^ channels return from inactivated state to closed state (without opening)
7. closure of voltage-gated K^+^ channels returns the membrane potential to its resting value

#### Membrane permeability in an action potential

### Action potential propagation down the axon
### Refractory periods
- periods when the axon cannot respond to the receptors which are disengaged 
**absolute refactory period:**
- period during an action potential when a second stimulus (no matter what strength) cannot produce another action potential
- when voltage gate Na^+^ channels are open/just been inactivated
- membrane needs to repolarize so that inactivation gate can be removed
**relative refractory period:**
- follows absolute period
- some but not all voltage-gated Na^+^ channels are back at resting
- some K^+^ channels are open
- needs a large signal to overcome low availability of Na^+^ channels and open K^+^ channels

![](https://i.imgur.com/dBuPgwK.png =350x)

#### Action potential propogation down the axon
- the propagation of the action potential from the axon hillock to the axon-terminal end is typically **one-way** as the absolute refractory period follows along in wake of the moving action potential

### Velocity of an action potential
**depends on:**
1. axon diameter
    - large diameter = less resistance to current flow
2. insulation (myelination)
    - prevents current leak so current moves further
    - forces action potential to leap from node to node

### Clinical relevance
- blocking action potentials in medicine
- local anesthetics block voltage-gated ion channels: prevent them from opening
- tetrodotoxin: binds to voltage-gated Na^+^ channels
