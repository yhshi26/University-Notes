### Sequence of events in muscle contraction
Muscle contraction = signaling event → contraction 
Signaling: neuromuscular junction
- nerve action potential → change membrane potential in muscle 
Fiber contraction: excitation-contraction coupling and sliding filament mechanism
- increases calcium in the muscle fiber → causes sliding of thick and thin filaments

### How does nerve signaling induce muscle contraction: the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)
- what happens when an action potential reaches the axon terminal?
- how is singla communicated from neuron to muscle cell?
- **what happens in the muscle fiber?**

#### The NMJ
- the junction of the axon terminal with a muscle fiber

### Excitation-contraction coupling
- the sequence of events by which an action potential in the plasma membrane of a muscle fiber activates the force-generating mechanism
- the action potential is completed before any mechanical activity begins
- the electrical activity doesn't directly act on the muscle fiber filaments
- instead, the change in membrane potential (action potential) of the muscle fiber leads to icnreased **intracellular calcium**

## Sequence of events in excitation-contraction coupling
- the sequence of events by which an action potential in the plasma membrane of a muscle fiber activates the force-generating mechanism

- dihydropyridine (DHP) receptor is a coltage sensor in the T-tubule membrane of the muscle fiber
- DHP senses the change in membrane potential and changes conformation to interact with the ryanodine receptor in the sarcoplasmic reticulum
- DHP-ryanodine receptor interaction opens the ryanodine receptor channel and calcium is released into the cytosol
### Steps 3-4: sliding filament mechanism
- calcium binds to troponin on the thin filament which then complexes with tropomysoin to free up **actin** in the **thin** filament to bind with **myosin** in the **thick** filament
### Steps 5-6: contraction is terminated
(by reducing clacium concentration in the cytosol)
- an active pump (Ca^2+^ -ATPase) in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) removes calcium from the cytosol and returns it to the SR
- this reduction in calcium removes calcium from binding with troponin
