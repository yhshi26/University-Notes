### Cells: the basic structural units of life

- self-sufficient
- contain dna that codes for all proteins (excluding gametes)
- generate energy
- recycle components
- divide (usually)

#### **Cell types:** 

- epithelial, connective, nerve, muscle

#### **Tissue types (collections of cells):** 

- epithelial, connective, nerve, muscle

**Body composition:**

Avrg 70 kg human - 60% water:

- 3L plasma
- 11L interstitial fluid
- 28L intracellular fluid

### Homeostasis: most physiological vars such as bp, temp, blood gases, must be maintained within a predictable range

Homeostasis refers to physiological vars in a state of dynamic consistency

Homeostasis depends on **cell-cell communication:**

- cell signaling facilitates communication
- signal transduction is the mech that transmits a signal from outside to inside to respond to environmental stimuli

### Reflexes: specific, involuntary, unpremeditated, "built-in" responses to particular stimuli

e.g. pulling hand away from a hot object, shutting your eyes as an object approaches them

Pathway: stimulus → receptor (afferent pathway) → integrating center → (efferent pathway) effector → response → negative feedback

#### **Hormones and glands can be reflex components:**

- almost all body cells can act as effectors in homeostatic reflexes
- **muscles and glands** are the **major effectors of biological control systems**
    - **glands:** both a receptor and an integrating center
    - glands secrete hormones into blood that act as effectors
        - **hormone:** a type of chemical messenger secreted into blood by cells of endocrine system
        - hormones act on many different cells simultaneously because they circulate throughout the body

#### **Control systems:**

Feedback loops or systems are a common mech to control physiological processes

- a positive feedback system enhances the production of the product or accelerates a process
- a negative feedback system brings about responses that move a variable opposite to the direction of its original change

### General principles of physiology:

1. homeostasis is essential for health and survival
2. the functs of organ systems are coordinated with each other
3. most physiological functs are controlled by multiple regulatory systems, often working in opposition
4. information flows between cells, tissues, and organs - this is an essential feature of homeostasis that allows the integration of physiological processes
5. controlled exchange of materials occurs between compartments and across cellular membranes
6. physiological processes are dictated by the laws of chemistry and physics
7. physiological processes require the transfer and balance of matter and energy
8. structure is a determinant of - and coevolved with - function

### **Body fluid compartments:**

**Body fluid:** refers to the watery solution of dissolved substances (oxygen, nutrients, and wastes) present in the body
**Extracellular fluid:** refers to the fluid in the blood and in spaces surrounding the cells (essentially all fluid outside of cells
- of this, 20 to 25% is in the fluid portion of blood (plasma); the remaining 75 to 80% lies around and between cells and is called the interstitial fluid
- the space containing interstitial fluid is called the interstitium

The total volume of extracellular fluid is the sum of the plasma and interstitial fluid volumes

**Intracellular fluid**: refers to fluid located inside the cells and accounts for 67% of all the fluid in the body

The composition of the extracellular fluid is very different from that of the intracellular fluid
- maintaining differences in fluid composition across the cell membrane is an important way in which cells regulate their own activity

### **Reflexes:**

The pathway mediating a reflex is known as the reflex arc:
- a reflex arc has several components: stimulus, receptor, afferent (incoming) pathway, integrating center, efferent (outgoing) pathway, and effector
- stimulus: a detectable change in the internal or external environment
- receptor: detects the environmental change
- afferent pathway: for the signal travelling between the receptor and the integrating center 
- efferent pathway: for information going from the integrating center to the effector 
- integrating centerL receives signals from many receptors, some of which may respond to quite different types of stimuli

Thus, the output of an integrating center reflects the net effect of the total afferent input; that is, it represents an integration of numerous bits of information
