**Typical sizes of cell structures:**

**Multicellular organization:**

**Tissue:** multicellular association formed by a single type of cells

Tissues aggregate to form → functional units → organs → systems

### **Common features of all cells:**

- **DNA:** genetic material containing 1+ chromosomes
- **plasma membrane:** phospholipid bilayer separating cell from surrounding environment, acts as a selective barrier for import and export of materials
- **cytoplasm:** material of cell within the plasma membrane and the nucleoid region or nucleus, consists of fluid (cytosol) and the organelles and other particles suspended in it
- **ribosomes:** site of protein synthesis

The internal structure of a living cell can be seen with a light microscope

#### **Visualizing cell ultrastructure:**

- transmission electron microscopy
- presence of organelles
- internal membrane compartmentalize the cell

### **Nucleus:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/WciqTxm.png =250x)

#### **General:**

Structure: 

- largest organelle, round or oval body, located near cell center, usually appear uniform (except in neutrophils)

Function:

- stores and transmits genetic information (in the form of DNA) to next generation of cells
- genetic information passes from nucleus to cytoplasm where amino acids form proteins → **central dogma of molecular biology:** the process of transcription and translation cannot be reversed (nucleic acids → proteins but no proteins → nucleic acids)

#### **Chromatin:** 

Structure: coiled strands of DNA

- nucleus structure is dynamic, with chromatin condensing into chromosomes near mitosis

#### **Nuclear envelope:** 

Structure: phospholipid bilayer with nuclear pores as gaps 

Function: separates genetic material from the rest of the cell

#### **Nucleolus:** 

Structure:

- densely stained filamentous structure in nucleus
- contains proteins associated with DNA in regions where information concerning ribosomal proteins is being expressed

Function:

- site of ribosomal RNA synthesis
- assembles RNA and protein components of ribosomal subunits, which then move to cytoplasm via nuclear pores

### **Ribosomes:**

Structure:

- comprised of RNA and proteins
- in eukaryotic cells, 80S ribosomes formed from 40S and 60S subunits
![](https://i.imgur.com/3a10d2z.png =150x)
    

Function:

- site of protein synthesis
    - synthesizes proteins using genetic information carried by mRNA (messenger RNA) from DNA in nucleus
    
    #### **Depending on localization, there are 2 types of proteins synthesized:**
    
    - the proteins synthesized on the free ribosomes are released into the cytosol, where they perform their varied functions
    - the proteins synthesized by ribosomes attached to rough endoplasmic reticulum pass into the lumen of the reticulum and are then transferred to the golgi apparatus to be packaged and processed

### **Endoplasmic reticulum (network-like structure):**

![](https://i.imgur.com/AOIz9y3.png =300x)

#### **Rough endoplasmic reticulum:**

Structure:

- membranous network of flattened sacs
- encloses a space that is continuous throughout the organelle and with the space between the two nuclear envelope membranes
- has ribosomes attached to its cytosolic surface

Function:

- proteins synthesized on the attached ribosomes enter the lumen of the reticulum from which to be distributed to other organelles or secreted from the cell

#### **Smooth endoplasmic reticulum:** 

Structure:

- highly branched tubular network that does not have attached ribosomes but may be continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum

Function:

- contains enzymes for fatty acid and steroid synthesis
- stores and releases calcium, which controls various cell activities

### **Golgi apparatus:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/OOpbq3Q.png =200x)
On cis side: transfer vesicles, on trans side: transport (secretory) vesicles

Structure:

- series of cup-shaped, closely apposed, flattened, membranous sacs; associated with numerous vesicles
- generally, a single golgi apparatus is located near the center of a cell by the nucleus

Function:

- concentrates, modifies, and sorts proteins arriving (post-translational modification) from the rough endoplasmic reticulum prior to their distribution, by way of the golgi vesicles, to other organelles or to secretion from the cell

### **Mitochondrion:** 

![](https://i.imgur.com/Huodmxf.png =200x)

Structure:

- Rod/oval-shaped body enclosed by 2 membranes
    - inner membrane folds into matrix of the mitochondrion, forming cristae (increases surface area → more in high metabolic cells)

Function:

- major site of ATP production, oxygen utilization, and carbon dioxide formation
- contains proteins necessary for cellular respiration
    - contains enzymes active Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation

#### **Mitochondrial reticulum (network) in skeletal muscle cells:**

They also have other important functions in:

- cell signaling
- apoptosis
- shortening of lipids (very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs))

#### **Endosymbiotic theory of mitochondrial origin:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/jGdnkkp.png =300x)

Theory proposed by Lynn Margulis

#### **Mitochondrial disease:**

- mitochondrial diseases appear to cause most damage to:
    - brain, heart, liver, skeletal muscles, kidney, endocrine and respiratory systems
- depending on cells effected, symptoms may include:
    - loss of motor control, muscle weakness/pain, gastrointestinal disorders, swallowing difficulties, poor growth, cardiac disease, liver disease, diabetes, respiratory complications, seizures, visual/hearing impairment, lactic acidosis, developmental delays, and susceptibility to infection

### **Lysosomes:** 

![](https://i.imgur.com/4yE3Z9J.png =200x)

Function:

- functions as disposal unit of cell - digest proteins (e.g. food, bacteria etc.)
    - fluid within lysosome is acidic, contains digestive enzymes
    - plays an important role in cells of the defense systems of the body

#### **Lysosomal enzyme failure:** 

Irish travelling community have the highest recorded frequency of lysosomal storage disorders world-wide. Incidence 1 in 371. Carrier frequency 1 in 10.

- hurler disease (mucopolysaccharidosis): alpha-l-iduronidase, sanfilippo syndrome a: heparan sulphate sulphamidase, tay-sachs (gangliosidosis): hexosaminidase-a, gaucher (1:40000): beta-d-glycosidase, l-cell disease (mucolipidosis): phosphotransferase defect)

### **Peroxisomes: similar to lysosome, but different enzymes** 

![](https://i.imgur.com/DrYecBl.png =200x)

Structure:

- usually contain enzymes that use molecular oxygen to remove hydrogen atoms from organic substrates in an oxidative reaction that produces H2O2

Function:

- generate and degrade H2O2
- breakdown fatty acids, alcohol (in liver)
    - abundant in detoxifying organs (liver, kidneys, etc.)
- formed in cytoplasm

#### **Zellweger syndrome:**

- genetic disorder characterized by reduction/absence of peroxisomes
- symptoms: enlarged liver, high levels iron and copper in blood, vision disturbances
    - symptoms at birth: lack of muscle tone, inability to move
    - associated with impaired neuronal migration and brain development, hypomyelination

### **A cell must be dynamic to respond to changes in environment:**

- when there is a change in its environment, a cell responds by expressing different sets of proteins (a different proteome)
    - proteins are building blocks of the cell
    - genotype: complete set of hereditary genes
    - phenotype: composite observable characteristics of an organism (genotype + environment + (epigenetics))
- hence, by expressing different proteins (different proteome), a cell can change its phenotype to better suit its environment

### **Summary:**

Protein production: nucleus, nucleolus, rough/smooth ER, golgi apparatus

Energy: mitochondria

Recycling: lysosome

Detoxing: peroxisome
