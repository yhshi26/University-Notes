## Cell-cell communication types

### Receptor functions of proteins

### 2 classes of ligands and receptors

#### Hydrophobic ligands
- duration in blood longer than water soluble hormones
- transported in combination with other blood components
- duration of signal: hours/days
- effect lasts: days/months/lifetime
- <50 receptors in humans

## Structure of steroid receptors
![](https://i.imgur.com/FIZ6CP9.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/iGs901M.png =150x)
- ligand domain
- PPI domains for regulating proteins
- DNA binding domain
- transcription-activating domain: binds to regulators or TFs
- **each receptor has different DNA binding sequences and regulate different genes**

### Inactive vs. active receptor 
- upon binding of ligand, there is conformational change 
- effect of PPI and binding to promoters
- binding of negative regulators return to inactive state or stops transcription

### Fast vs. slow response

## Steroid hormones
- steroid hormones produced by colesterol
- hydrophobic molecules
- bind to nuclear* (*sometimes intracellular receptors are called nuclear receptors) receptors (in cytosol or nucleus)
    - a single receptor can activate different gene sets in different cell types
- released into bloodstream by endocrine organs
    - act over long distances
    - act over long time periods
    - generally bound to plasma carrier proteins

### Families
| Family | Specific hormone | Primary site of synthesis | Primary receptor | 
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- | 
| progestin | progesterone | ovary, placenta | progesterone receptor | 
| glucocorticoid | cortisol, corticosterone | adrenal cortex | glucocorticoid receptor | 
| mineralocorticoid | aldosterone, 11-deoxucorticosterone | adrenal cortex | mineralocorticoid receptor | androgen | testosterone, dihydrotestosterone | testis | androgen receptor | 
| estrogen | estradiol-17b, estriol | ovary, placenta | estrogen receptor | 
(*know names for exam, where synthesized)

### Examples
#### Glucocorticoids (cortisol and corticosterone)
Sequence of activation:
- signal via steroid hormone receptor
    - glucocorticoid receptor
- activated GR binds to glucocorticoide response element in promoter regions (GREs)
- binding at GREs induces or suppresses gene activation
- inhibit inflammatory gene expression
- major class of drugs (hydrocortisone)
- serious side effects (chushing's syndrome)

- cortisol is an endogenous anti-inflammatory hormone
- secreted by adrenal glands (medulla)
- slower resopnse may regulate a series of TF as a result of the expression/repression of specific genes

##### Glucocorticoids in medicine
- anti-inflammatories
    - hydrocortisone and many others
    - potent anti-inflammatory effect
    - immunosuppression
    - cushingâ€™s syndrome (hypersecretion or hydrocortisone treatment)

#### Estrogen (and similarly, testosterone)
- signal via estrogen receptor
- activated ER binds to response element in  promoter regions of genes to induce or suppress gene activation
- increases cell proliferation gene expression
- overactivation can result in cancer
- therapeutic target in breast cancer (tamoxifen)

##### Estrogen in medicine
- over-expression of ER in many types of breast cancer
- tamoxifen is an ER receptor antagonist
