### **Visualizing with electron microscope:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/Msd2AIt.png =300x)

- EM shows there are 3 layers: inner, outer and middle
- note characteristic trilaminar appearance
    - 2 outer electro-dense layers separated by electron lucent layer
    - phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins

### **History: discovering cell membrane structure**

#### Ernest Overton (1890s):

- dissolving power of outer layer of cell matched that of a fatty oil

#### Gorter and Grendel (1925):

- measure surface area of lipid extracted from red blood cell, proposed lipid bilayer
- suggested polar head groups face outwards

#### Singer and Nicholson (1972):

- fluid mosaic model

### **Chemical composition:**

- membranes are lipid-protein assemblies
- core of membrane consists of lipid bilayer serving as structural backbone
    - lipids: act as barrier preventing random movement of water-soluble material in and out of cell
    - proteins: carry out more specific functions
- ratio of lipid to protein varies with cell type and function

#### **All membranes consist of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins:**

- the phospholipids in the bilayer are amphipathic (i.e. consist of a polar, hydrophilic head and non-polar hydrophobic tail)
    
    
    #### **Other components of membrane with important functions:**
    
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/uiUi4zy.jpg =300x)

    ##### **2 classes of membrane proteins:**
    - **integral membrane proteins:**
        - are amphipathic 
        - are closely associated with the membrane lipids
        - cannot be extracted from the membrane without disrupting the lipid bilayer
        - (most integral proteins span the entire membrane and are referred to as **transmembrane proteins,** but there are proteins that are only in 1 of the layers)
    - **peripheral membrane proteins:**
        - are not amphipathic
        - do not associate with nonpolar regions of the lipids in the interior of the membrane
        - bound to the polar regions of the integral membrane proteins or through lipid modifications

    #### **Carbohydrate (CHO):**
    - **glycocalyx**
    - plasma membranes contain carbohydrate linked to both lipid (glycolipid) and protein (glycoprotein) components
    - **all carbohydrates face outwards** (into extracellular space)
    - can display considerable variability in composition and structure
    - blood group antigens A, B, O

    #### **Cholesterol:** 
    
    - stiffens membranes at normal/higher temps
    - maintains membrane fluidity at lower temps (buffer)
        
       ![](https://i.imgur.com/GnX71kl.png =300x)
        
    
    **Fluid-mosaic model of plasma membrane:**
    - **fluid:** no fixed structure
        - elements can flow
        - proteins move laterally along the membrane
    - **mosaic:** composed of proteins and lipids that are unevenly distributed 

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/1NtP88c.jpg =300x)

    
    **Plasma membrane is asymmetric:**
    
    - phospholipids and glycolipids are distributed asymmetrically in the plasma membrane and lipid bilayer

## **Membrane structure summary:**

- all membranes consist of a double layer of lipid molecules containing embedded proteins
- the major membrane lipids are phospholipids
    - phospholipids are amphipathic
    - the phospholipids in plasma membranes are organized into a bilayer with the nonpolar     fatty acid chains in the middle
    - the polar regions of the phospholipids are oriented toward the surfaces of the membrane as a result of their attraction to the polar water molecules in the extracellular fluid and cytosol
- the plasma membrane also contains cholesterol, whereas intracellular membranes contain very little cholesterol
    - the close association of the nonpolar rings of cholesterol with the fatty acid tails of phospholipids tends to limit the ordered packing of fatty acids in the membrane
    - a more highly ordered, tightly packed arrangement of fatty acids tends to reduce membrane fluidity
    - thus, cholesterol and phospholipids have a coordinated function in maintaining an intermediate membrane fluidity
    - cholesterol may also play a role in the formation of vesicles, membrane packages that     are used to deliver their contents to various intracellular organelles
- there are two classes of membrane proteins: integral and peripheral
    - integral membrane proteins are closely associated with the membrane lipids and cannot be extracted from the membrane without disrupting the lipid bilayer
        - they are amphipathic
        - most integral proteins span the entire membrane and are referred to as transmembrane proteins
        - the polypeptide chains of many of these transmembrane proteins cross the lipid bilayer several times
        - some transmembrane proteins form channels through which ions or water can cross the membrane, whereas others are associated with the transmission of chemical signals across the membrane or the anchoring of extracellular and intracellular protein filaments to the plasma membrane
    - peripheral membrane proteins are not amphipathic and do not associate with the nonpolar regions of the lipids in the interior of the membrane
        - they are located at the membrane surface where they are bound to the polar regions of the integral membrane proteins or to the lipid belayer through lipid modifications

### **Membrane function:**

1. #### **Compartmentalization:**
    - PM encloses entire cell, other membranes enclose intracellular spaces e.g. nucleus.
    - membrane-bound compartments of cell possess different contents
    - specialized activities can occur and be regulated independently of one another
2. #### **Scaffold for biochemical activities**
    - membranes are a distinct compartment
    - membranes provide the cell with an extensive framework or scaffolding within which components can be ordered for effective interaction
    - cell not dependent on random collision of molecules
3. #### **Intercellular interaction (lectures 5-7)**
    - mediates the interaction between a cell and its neighbors
    - allows cells
        - to recognize each other
        - to signal to each other
        - to adhere to each other
        - to exchange materials and information
4. #### **Respond to external signals (lectures 17-25)**
    - plasma membrane plays a critical role in the response of a cell to external stimuli â€“ signal transduction
    - possesses receptors that bind to specific molecules (ligands) with complementary structure
        - different cells have different receptors and so can bind different ligands
    - cell is capable of recognizing and responding to different signals in different environment
    - signal may stimulate or inhibit cellular activities
5. #### **Energy transduction**
    - membranes are intimately involved in the process by which one type of energy is converted into another type (energy  transduction)
    - in eukaryotes machinery for energy conversion is contained within membranes of mitochondria
6. #### **Transporting solutes and molecules**
    - can physically transport substances from one side of the membrane to the other
    - allows a cell to accumulate substances e.g., sugars and amino acids
    - able to transport specific ions thereby establishing ionic gradients (lectures 8-15)

### **Transport across plasma membranes:**
Plasma membranes mediate the exchange of materials between internal and external environments of the cell

#### **Four principal mechanisms:**
1. passive diffusion
2. facilitated diffusion
3. active transport
4. bulk transport

![](https://i.imgur.com/mgZv6mE.png =250x)

##### **Passive diffusion:**

Dependent on the presence of a concentration gradient across the plasma membrane

- lipids and lipid-soluble molecules eg ethanol
- small molecules e.g. water and urea
- inorganic ions such as bicarbonate

Impermeable to large hydrophilic molecules

![](https://i.imgur.com/Utqj437.png =300x)

The movement of molecules from one location to another solely as a result of their random thermal motion is known as **diffusion**

2. ##### **Facilitated diffusion through transporters**
    - involves movement of large hydrophilic molecules - concentration dependent
    - can occur in either direction
    - strictly passive but requires protein carrier molecules (gated pores), molecules bind specifically but reversibly       
![](https://i.imgur.com/q3kiE5W.png =300x)

    **Transporters:**

    - transporters have chemical specificity for their ligand
    - transporters don't move as many solutes per unit time as ion channels do because they must change their conformation for each molecule moved across the membrane
    - transporters can become saturated, this means that there is a max flux of molecules across the membrane that can be reached
    - **they can be involved in passive diffusion [no energy] or active transport [ATP or energy involved]**

    **Mediated transport systems reach a maximal flux rate while diffusion of ions through ion channels doesn't:** 
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/J6W8IGh.png =200x)

3. ##### **Active transport:**
    - independent of concentration gradients
    - often acts against extreme gradients
        - depends on integral proteins
        - **uses energy (ATP)** 
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/5UckcZd.png =250x)

    **Active transport of Na+ and K+ mediated by the Na+/K+ -ATPase pump:**

    - proteins that carry out active transport are often referred to as pumps
    - classic example is the Na/K pump that pumps potassium into the cell and sodium out of the cells
    - ATP is converted into ADP to allow this process
    - for each ATP, 3K go into the cell and 2Na go out of the cell
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/rJTEUt9.png =300x)

    **Summary of active transport:**

    Active transport uses energy to move a substance against its concentration gradient. Because these transporters move a substance uphill, they are often referred to as â€œpumps". These pumps can also become saturated and use two types of energy sources:

    - the direct use of ATP in primary active transport, and
    - the use of an electrochemical gradient across a membrane to drive the process in secondary active
    transport

4. ##### **Bulk transport**
    - does not require molecules to pass through structural matrix of plasma membrane
    - transport of large molecules or small particles into the cell - range of mechanisms
        1. phagocytosis
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/B6MLPnt.png =250x)
        2. receptor-mediated endocytosis
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/HkXK1aI.png =250x)
        3. exocytosis: secretion of cell product
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/W5Q5UvI.png =250x)
        4. pinocytosis: uptake of small volume of extracellular fluid in nonspecific manner
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/VNPVdYt.png =250x)
        5. transcytosis: taken up then secreted
