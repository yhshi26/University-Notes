###### tags: `MDSA20170 - Vascular Biology`

## Learning objectives
- Be aware of the anatomy of the neck, including its boundaries, surface anatomy, compartments and contents
- Know the origin and course of the common carotid arteries
- Know the origin, course, branches and supply of the internal and external carotid arteries
- Be aware of certain clinical aspects of the carotid arteries

## Neck anatomy
- Superior boundary:
    - Inferior margins of mandible/skull, superior nuchal line
- Inferior boundary: 
    - Acromia/clavicle/sternum: spinous process of C7 (CVII)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/6Gzhu47.png =250x)

### Compartments
- Vertebral: cervical vertebrae and associated muscles
- Visceral: thyroid/parathyroids/thymus, parts of respiratory/digestive tracts
- Vascular: major vessels and vagus nerve
- All enclosed by a musculofascial collar
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/QbRDUJS.png =200x)

### Cross-sectional levels
- Defined by cervical vertebrae (C1-7), the hyoid bone and laryngeal cartilages
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/GuuCZBl.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/KOZyqgD.png =175x)

#### Important cross-sectional levels
- Lateral to cricoid cartilage: for carotid pulse
- C4: for carotid bifurcation
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/QLKBzQU.png =350x)

### Triangles
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/AZS8uH9.png =400x)
- Anterior: further subdivided into submandibular, submental, carotid, muscular triangles
- Posterior: occipital, supraclavicular
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/8MkcB5B.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/3edeiXg.png =250x)

#### Carotid triangle
- Following vessels pass through here (enclosed in carotid sheath)
- Common carotid arteries and terminal branches, i.e. internal and external carotid arteries; internal jugular vein and tributaries pass as well
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/j5rOBp4.png =450x)

## Common carotids
- Start of "carotid system"
- Both ascend in neck, lateral to trachea and oesophagus within carotid sheath
- Right common carotid:
    - From brachiocephalic trunk just behind right sternoclavicular joint
    - Lies in neck through entire course 
- Left common carotid:
    - A direct branch of arch of aorta
    - Enters neck near left sternoclavicular joint
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Qz8oIln.png =350x)

### Bifurcation
- At upper level of thyroid cartilage (~C4), common carotids divide into terminal branches:
    - External carotid artery: supplies external head and neck
    - Internal carotid artery: supplies intracranial structures and eye
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/3ClqXgb.png =350x)

### Carotid sinus
- Where internal branches off common, a dilation is found:
    - Carotid sinus
- Important area for monitoring of blood pressure by brain (baroreceptors)
- Also here, carotid body monitors blood composition in CVS
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/BtlfGzu.png =350x)

### Carotid sheath
- Column of fascia surrounding following structures:
    - Common/internal carotids
    - Internal jugular vein
    - Vague nerve (10th cranial nerve, CNX)
    - Deep cervical lymph nodes
    - Nerve of carotid sinus
    - Other nerves higher up only
- Runs from origin of vessels to base of skull
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/X6Hd8nt.png =250x)

### Internal carotid
- After branching
- Ascends to base of skull
- No branches in neck
- Enters skull via carotid canal in petrous part of temporal bone
- Supplies cerebral hemispheres, eyes, contents of orbits and forehead
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/7WD5UeR.png =250x)

### Relevant foramena in skull

#### Terminal branches (2)
1. Maxillary artery
    - Largest branch
    - Arises posterior to neck of mandible, passes through parotid gland to neck of mandible and into infratemporal fossa
    - Supplies upper and lower jaw, nasal cavity, muscles of mastication, middle meningeal artery
    - ![](https://thumbor.kenhub.com/L6Fg3RpTL-ZkJViyts7gZqlRERI=/fit-in/940x940/filters:fill(FFFFFF,true):watermark(/images/watermark_only.png,0,0,0):watermark(/images/logo_url.png,-10,-10,0):format(jpeg)/images/anatomy_term/maxillary-artery-3/E3gBm1iP4kPsncdiLOt3RQ_maxillary_artery_2.png =250x)
    - Clinical consideration: extradural hemorrhage
        - Results primarily from injuries to middle meningeal arteries
        - Major/minor blow to side of head
        - Bleeding strips meningeal layer from skull
        - Compression of brain occurs as intracranial pressure increases
        - Can lead to neurological dysfunction or death
2. Superficial temporal artery
    - Passes anterior to ear crossing zygomatic process of temporal bone (where it is easily palpable) and divides into anterior and posterior branches
    - Terminates in subcutaneous tissue of scalp
    - Supplies facial muscles/skin of temporal region
    - ![](https://thumbor.kenhub.com/4ZwI-uttMYsUoiLhmsmfX6tecyo=/fit-in/800x1600/filters:watermark(/images/logo_url.png,-10,-10,0):background_color(FFFFFF):format(jpeg)/images/library/13357/Superficial_temporal_artery.png =250x)

## Clinical considerations
- Carotid pulse: lateral to cricoid on C6 transverse vertebrae (careful not to inadvertently perform carotid sinus massage and slow down pulse)
    - ![](https://ssl.adam.com/graphics/images/en/9800.jpg =250x)
- Carotid endarterectomy:
    - Surgical removal of plaque from inside (end-) of carotid
    - Performed to reduce risk of stroke
    - ![](https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2013/08/26/10/04/my00656_ds01030_im04062_mcdc7_carotid_angioplastythu_jpg.jpg =250x)
- Carotid sinus massage: opposite thyroid cartilage
    - Stimulates baroreceptors which are capable of slowing heart rate (reflex action via glossopharyngeal nerve, CNIX)
    - Never massage both sides at same time (can cut off supply)
    - Be sure that there is no blockage before performing
- Carotid sinus reflex death: has (controversially) been pointed out as possible cause of death in cases of strangulation, hanging and auto-erotic asphyxiation
    - Strong CNIX impulses leading to terminal cardiac arrest
