## Learning objectives
- Know the divisions of the mediastinum
- Know the boundaries and contents of these divisions
- Be able to describe the relations of key structures of each division
- Be able to recognise mediastinal structures on cross-sectional thoracic images

## Circulation overview 
- Centre of circulation = heart 
- Arterial and venous system
- Arteries have branches, veins have tributaries
- Collateral circulation: simple bypass 
    - Alternative routes for blood to get to a tissue if there is a blockage 
- Collateral circulation: anastomosis 
    - Removal of a large part of a tissue but not getting rid of all blood supply to the tissue 
- Relations: injury to or lesions of neighbouring structures may damage or compress blood vessels
    - i.e. tumours in vesinity of blood vessel may compress and close that blood vessel
- Filters in blood stream 
    - Main example is the liver 
    - Reclaim nutrients/remove toxins 
- Monitoring points
    - Blood pressure: baro receptors in the blood that monitor blood pressure and send info back to the brain which can then regulate 

## Mediastinum
- Central compartment of the thoracic cavity between the 2 pleural cavities 
- Extends vertically from thoracic inlet to diaphragm
- Contains essentially all thoracic viscera and structures except for lungs

- Borders of compartment:
    - Superior border top of first rib
    - Inferior border base of the ribs (diaphragm)
    - Lateral borders the pleural membranes of right and left lung 
        - Specifally the mediastinal pleura 
    - Posterior border bodies of thoracic vertebrae 
    - Anterior border sternum and costal cartilages 

### Divisions:
- Superior mediastinum
    - From thoracic inlet to junction of T4/5 discs
- Inferior mediastinum
    - Subdivided by pericardium into (3):
        1. Anterior
        2. Middle
        3. Posterior

#### Superior mediastinum
- Thoracic inlet to a transverse thoracic plane at sternal angle
- Transverse thoracic plane: passes through sternal angle and T4/5 disc
- Lateral boundary: mediastinal pleura

##### Contents:
- Veins: brachiocephalic veins (drains from arm and head) and superior vena cava 
- Arteries: arch of aorta and 3 large branches 
- Organs: trachea, oesophagus
- Lymphatics: thoracic duct 
- Nerves: phrenic nerves (supply diaphragm), vagus nerves
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/pkEnURf.png =350x)
- Brachiocephalic (BC) veins
    - Formed posterior to the sternoclavicular joints
    - Formed by union of internal jugular and subclavian veins
    - Lie anterior to arteries
    - Left is more than twice as long as right 
    - Both unite at level of 1st costal cartilage on right to form the superior vena cava (SVC)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/ODtzU2p.png =250x)
- Superior vena cava (SVC)
    - Formed at level of 1st costal cartilage (CC1)
    - Receives azygos vein at CC2
    - Enters right atrium at CC3
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/Wu1A6jz.png =250x)
    - Separated from pleura by right phrenic nerve laterally
        - Right phrenic nerve passes over right side of superior vena cava
        - From roots C3-C5
        - "C3, C4, C4 keeps the diaphragm alive"
        - Fortunately, patients with spinal cord injuries below the neck are still able to breathe effectively, despite any paralysis of lower limbs
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/AuSiZrZ.png =250x)
- Aorta
    - Thoracic portion of aorta divided into (3):
        1. Ascending aorta (exits heart)
        2. Arch of aorta
        3. Descending thoracic aorta (down to diaphragm)
    - Bifurcates (splits in 2) in abdomen
    - Course of aorta commences in middle mediastinum with ascending aorta
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/vuc9Lvf.png =250x)
    - Aortic arch: branches (most individuals have 3):
        1. Brachiocephalic trunk
            - Dives into right subclavian artery and right common carotid artery
            - Right subclavian artery supplies right upper limb
            - Right common carotid artery supplies right side of head and neck
        2. Left common carotid artery 
            - Supplies left side of head and neck
        3. Left subclavian 
            - Supplies left upper limb
            - Supplies left side of head and neck
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/vS3FSfz.png =250x)
- Inferior mediastinum

        - Collateral pathways are important in case there is a blockage 
    - Major veins in the system 
        - Azygos vein: gathers tributaries directly from right side of thoracic wall and drains directly into the SVC
        - Hemiazygous vein: gather from left thoracic wall and drains indirectly into SVC by the azygos vein
