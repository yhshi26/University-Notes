# P1: Carotid Arteries
###### tags: `MDSA20170 â€“ Vascular Biology`

## General Aim of Practical:
The aim of this practical is to enable you to appreciate the origin, course and distribution of the
main arteries supplying the head and neck. This practical will also help you to understand how
the neck is divided into various compartments by cervical fascia, including the carotid sheath,
and into a number of anatomical triangles by various neck muscles. This practical will also
address some clinical aspects of the carotid vasculature.

> NOTE: Please consult a textbook, atlas or lecture notes where necessary.

## Specific Objectives:
At the end of the practical, students should be able to:
1. Define the boundaries of the neck;
2. Know the major bones and cartilages of the neck, and be able to locate and identify them
relative to surface anatomy;
3. Identify the sternocleidomastoid muscles, and know how this muscle acts as a boundary to
the anterior & posterior triangles;
4. Know how the anterior & posterior triangles are further subdivided by various strap muscles;
5. Identify the contents of the carotid triangle;
6. Locate the origin of the right and left common carotid arteries; what are the main relations of
the common carotid arteries in the thorax?
7. Know the course of the cervical portion of the common carotid arteries, and how they relate
to structures within the carotid sheath;
8. Identify the level of the carotid bifurcation, and be aware of two important structures found
at this location;
9. Identify the internal and external carotid arteries;
10. Identify the point of entry of the internal carotid to the skull; know the branches and
distribution of the internal carotid artery;
11. Know the branches and distribution of the external carotid arteries; (from which arteries do
the middle and inferior thyroid arteries arise?)
12. Know how to check the carotid pulse; under what conditions is it important to measure an
accurate carotid pulse? Identify the location for performing carotid sinus massage and
understand the clinical significance;
13. Be aware of the types/consequences of blockage to the carotid arteries and how these may
be treated.
