# P2: Mediastinum and abdominal wall supply
###### tags: `MDSA20170 â€“ Vascular Biology`

## General aim of practical:
The aim of this practical is to enable you to appreciate the region of the mediastinum, the
arrangement of the vessels of the mediastinum and how they relate to the organs and
structures within the thorax. This practical will also help you to understand some clinical
aspects of the mediastinal vasculature. In addition, this practical will enable you to appreciate
the arrangement of the large vessels supplying and draining the abdominal cavity and pelvis,
and how their branches/tributaries relate to abdominal/pelvic organs and structures.

## Specific Objectives:
### Mediastinum:
At the end of this practical, students should be able to:
1. Define the parts, boundaries and relations of the mediastinum;
2. Identify the ascending aorta and arch of aorta, and determine their relationship to the
pulmonary trunk; relate the structures to surface anatomy;
3. Identify the superior vena cava and its tributaries (right and left brachiocephalic veins, azygos
vein); relate the structures to surface anatomy; identify the subclavian and internal jugular
veins;
4. Locate the origin of the coronary vessels;
5. Locate and identify the branches of the aortic arch (brachiocephalic trunk, left common
carotid, left subclavian arteries); how do they relate to the tributaries of the superior vena
cava? how are subclavian arteries divided into 3 parts?
6. Locate the descending thoracic aorta and identify its branches (see lecture for details);
7. Identify the vagus nerve on the left and right side; how does the course of the recurrent
laryngeal nerve differ from right to left?
8. Identify the diaphragm and its relationship to the descending thoracic aorta; what structures
pass through the aortic hiatus?
9. Locate and identify the azygos vein and its tributaries (see lecture for details); locate and
identify the hemiazygos system of veins;
10. Locate and identify the thoracic duct and determine its extent (start and end);
11. Identify the oesophagus and its relations;
12. Know the relations of the descending thoracic aorta;
13. Be aware of the different types of aortic coarctation (pre-ductal, ductal, post-ductal);
14. Understand the conditions of ascending aortic aneurysm/dissection/transection.
Abdominal Aorta/IVC:
15. Identify the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava (IVC), and demonstrate their continuity
with structures in the thorax through the diaphragm;
16. Determine the extent (start and end) of the abdominal aorta;
17. Locate and identify the branches (paired & unpaired) of the abdominal aorta and their
relationship to the inferior vena cava;
18. Locate and identify the tributaries of the inferior vena cava and their relationship to the
abdominal aorta;
19. Determine the extent (start and end) of the inferior vena cava;
20. Identify the common iliac artery and vein and their relationship to the aorta;
21. Identify the external iliac artery and vein and follow them to their continuation as the
femoral artery and vein;
22. Identify the internal iliac vessels and define their relationship to peritoneum;
23. Demonstrate the relationship between the common iliac arteries and the common iliac
veins;

  - Heart: which chambers are visible on this view?

### Vessels:
(Refs. Moore & Agur, 2002, Figure 2.13; Moore & Dalley, 1999, Figures 1.22, 1.23 &1.34)
**Pulmonary trunk:** from the pulmonary valve up to the left second sternochondral junction.
**Ascending aorta:** from the aortic valve up to the right second sternochondral junction.
**Aortic arch:** deep to the inferior half of the manubrium.
**Brachiocephalic artery:** from its origin deep to the midpoint of the manubrium up to its bifurcation
deep to the right sternoclavicular joint.
**Left common carotid and subclavian arteries:** arise from the aortic arch to the left of the mid-point of
the manubrium; they converge toward the left sternoclavicular joint, to which they lie deep.
**Left brachiocephalic vein:** deep to the upper half of the manubrium.
**Superior vena cava:** from the middle of the right edge of the manubrium, where it forms, straight down
to the right third costal cartilage, where it enters the right atrium.
**Inferior vena cava:** enters the heart immediately after piercing the abdominal diaphragm, at a site
projecting immediately to the right of the xiphisternal joint.
**Trachea:** the trachea enters the thorax in the median (mid-sagittal) plane halfway between the vertebral column
and the manubrium. It bifurcates at the level of the sternal angle, slightly to the right of the midline.
**Lungs and pleurae:**
