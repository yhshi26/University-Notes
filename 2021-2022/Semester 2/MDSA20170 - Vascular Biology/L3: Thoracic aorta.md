## Learning objectives
- Know the origin of the aorta in the mediastinum, as well as its main branches, distribution & relations in the thorax
- Be aware of clinical aspects of the aorta in the thorax

### Aorta
- Thoracic portion of aorta divided into (3):
    1. Ascending aorta 
    2. Arch of aorta
    3. Descending (thoracic) aorta 
- Course commences in middle mediastinum with ascending aorta 
    - Starts on right side of heart then curves over to left into descending aorta
- Ascending aorta is within pericardial sac
    - If there is a bleed here, blood will fill pericardial space
- Most branches are from long descending part

### Ascending aorta 
- ~5 cm long, 2.5 cm in diameter 
- Located intrapericardially and inferior to transverse thoracic place in middle mediastinum 
- Ascends from aortic orifice of LV to sternal angle (costal cartilage 3 to CC2) 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/a63kesF.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/2GbLCE0.png =250x)
- Branches: right and left coronary arteries
    - They are only arteries to “fill” during ventricular diastole (fill as ventricles relax)
    - Behind aortic valve leaflets (cusps) there are 2 openings for coronary arteries 
    - When valve opens (during ventricular systole) leaflets open up to press against wall of aorta covering 2 openings to coronary artery 
    - When valve is closed when ventricles relax they can then fill as they are not covered anymore

### Aortic arch
- Superior mediastinum
- Curved continuation of ascending aorta
- Course:
    - It arches from behind 2nd right sternocostal joint/sternal angle superoposteriorly to left
    - Ends behind the 2nd left sternocostal joint (T4-T5) and becomes descending thoracic aorta
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/CqXVvZg.png =400x)
- Pulmonary trunk bifurcates beneath arch and arch travels over left bronchus
- 3 major branches:
    1. Brachiocephalic trunk: largest of 3 
        - Origin: behind manubrium of sternum
        - Divides into:
            - Right subclavian artery →	supplies right upper limb
            - Right common carotid artery →	supplies right head and neck 
    2. Left common carotid artery:
        - Supplies left side of head and neck
    3. Left subclavian artery:
        - Supplies left upper limb 
- This is most common arrangement but there is variation 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/L1AlPu5.png =350x)

### Subclavian arteries
- Divided into 3 parts by scalenus anterior muscle
    - Most branches arise from 1st part 
- 2nd part lies posterior to muscle 
- 3rd part becomes axillary artery and continues into upper limb
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Uk7dkRZ.png =350x)

## Ligamentum arteriosum
- Joins left pulmonary artery with aortic arch
    - From root of pulmonary trunk to aortic arch 
    - Circled in above diagram
- Doesn’t do anything in adults 
- Important in embryonic circulation as it allows blood to bypass lungs
    - After birth it is not functional and becomes blocked with fibrous tissue to be arterial ligament 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/L1AlPu5.png =350x)

## Recurrent laryngeal nerve 
- Positions of right and left nerve differ  
    - Right recurrent laryngeal nerve is much higher and courses beneath right subclavian artery
    
## Clinical observations 
### Coronary artery disease
- Leading cause of death worldwide
- Accumulation of atherosclerotic plaques
- Reduced bloodflow to heart muscle 
- Sudden chest pain
    - Typically radiating to left arm or left side of neck
- Affected artery can be stented or bypassed with autologous or synthetic graft 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/MXQ8F5i.png =200x)

### Aneurysm of ascending aorta
- Localised dilation can develop as wall is not reinforced by fibrous pericardium 
- With gradual enlargement aneurysm can lead to either dissection or rupture
    - Dissection is when blood enters wall of aorta and splits it in 2
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/UGz1VUW.png =200x) 

#### Marfans syndrome
- Defect in fibrillin 1 gene 
- In elastic tissues such as in aorta elastic tissue won't be as good and are not assembled correctly
- Elasticity of aorta is not as good which is problematic 
- With each pump of blood there is micro-damage as tissue cannot stretch properly → over years there is so much microdamage that it starts to expand and thin wall 

### Mediastinal hematoma
- Most commonly traumatic
- Bleed into mediastinum from any part of thoracic aorta

### Cardiac tamponade
- Compression of heart that occurs when fluid builds up in pericardial space
- Treated by drainage 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/PBuTRvU.png =200x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/D2eMi4I.png =100x)

## Posterior Mediastinum
- Located to T5-T12
- Posterior to pericardium and diaphragm, between parietal pleurae of lungs
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/fjXzz5A.png =200x)

## Thoracic Aorta 
- Course: begins on left side at level T4 and descends to T12 
    - Stays left but moves toward midline to lie in front of vertebral column
- Displaces esophagus to right
- Thoracic aortic plexus surrounds it
- Enters abdomen through aortic hiatus to become abdominal aorta
    - Aortic hiatus = hole in diaphragm located approximately T12
- Relations:
    - Posteriorly = vertebrae and hemizygos veins 
    - Anteriorly = root of left lung, pericardium and left arteries 
    - To its right: esophagus, thoracic duct and azygos veins 
    - To its left: left lung and pleura 
- T12 = aortic hiatus

### Thoracic aorta branches 
1. Bronchial: 1 right 2 left 
    - To airways
2. Esophageal
    - To esophagus 
3. Mediastinal 
    - To nodes/ connective tissue of mediastinum 
4. Pericardial
    - To pericardium 
5. Superior phrenic 
    - To diaphragm 
6. Posterior intercostals
    - 9 pairs (18 total) to 3rd-11th intercostal spaces 
    - 1st and 2nd posteriorintercostal artery don’t arise from thoracic aorta, they arise indirectly from subclavian 
7. On each side they branch from supreme intercostal artery 
8. Supreme intercostal artery is a branch of costoclavicular trunk and subclavian artery 
    - Beneath last rib there is subcostal arteries (cannot be intercostal if between last one) 
9. At front of chest wall are anterior intercostal arteries
    - Branches of internal thoracic arteries which is a branch of the subclavian artery

## Clinical Observations 
- Coarctation of aorta
    - Narrowing of a segment of aorta causing a high pressure build up at proximal side of coarctation 
    - Because pressure dissipates out through right branch, a classic sign is arterial hypertension in right arm and normal pressure in lower extremities 
    - Pulse delay in right femoral pulse 
    - Collaterals bring blood distally by branches from subclavian, internal thoracic, scapular and intercostal arteries
