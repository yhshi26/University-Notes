## Objective: 
This tutorial aims to reinforce the relevant topographical anatomy of the kidneys and ureters, engaging on clinical relevance. 
 
## Instructions:
The class will arrange themselves into three roughly equally sized groups: A, B, C. Using the lecture notes and your anatomy textbook or atlas, groups will discuss and work through the clinical scenario below. Following this, each group will present their answers to the entire class for review and discussion. 

You are called to the emergency room where a patient has a stab wound (penetrating injury) to the abdomen. A CT scan shows that the knife is embeded into the superior pole of the left kidney. 
 
1. List the structures the knife would pass through in a(n): 
    - Anterior attack (Group A) 
        - Skin, fascia under skin, psoas major muscle, ribs 11 & 12, spleen, stomach, transersis dominis music, quadratus lamborum, perinephric fat, renal fascia, perinephric fascia
    - Posterior attack (Group B) 
    - Lateral attack (Group C) 
 
2. It transpires that the kidney is not recoverable. The surgeon removes the kidney (nephrectomy). Assuming that the surgeon performs a laparotomy (large surgical incision through the (usually midline) abdominal wall to gain access into the abdominal cavity) because of concurrent trauma to other organs:  
    - What layers of renal fat and renal fascia will be incised to reach the kidney? 
        - Paranephic, renal and perinephric fascia
 
3. The ureter within the posterior abdominal wall is located and exposed:  
    - On what structures does it lie? 
        - Psoas major, bifurcation of the common iliac
 
4. The CT scan revealed right renal agenesis: the kidney is absent or under-developed, and is non-functioning. The patient now requires dialysis: procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys are not functioning properly. The patient is listed for transplantation and after several months a suitable donor kidney becomes available. The surgeon inspects the donor kidney in the operating room and confirms whether it is a left or right kidney they have received to transplant into the patient:  
    - How might this be determined from observing the donor kidney? 
        - Poles (up vs down): superior pole is flattened and covered by superrenal gland, inferior pole is pointed
        - Borders (medial vs lateral): medial border is rounded inward, lateral border is rounded outward
    
5. In a kidney transplant:  
    - Where would the new donor kidney be placed and where would the renal vessels be attached? 
        - Left or right iliac fossa
