# Learning objectives
###### tags: `MDSA20190 - Renal Biology`

## Physiology
### Renal histology
- Describe structures and functions of human kidneys and urinary tract
- Demonstrate understanding of the homeostatic roles sustained by the kidneys
- Use knowledge of the phenomena and mechanisms occurring in the kidneys and urinary tract to explain the performance of their homeostatic functions and to predict the principal consequences of renal diseases that alter these functions

### Ureter and bladder histology
- Describe structures and functions of the ureters and bladder
- Know histology of the ureters and bladder
- Explain ureteral contraction
- Describe urothelium (transitional epithelium)
- Explain urothelium response to filling/voiding

## Anatomy
### Pelvic cavity, peritoneum and perineum
- Pelvis: bony framework for inferior urinary structures
    - With muscular pelvic walls and floor
- Pelvic cavity: contains urinary, reproductive and excretory organs
- Perinuem: shallow compartment below pelvic floor
- Peritoneum: lining of adbominopelvic cavity and viscera
- Pelvic vessels and nerves

### Gross anatomy of the kidneys and ureters
- Superior urinary system
    - Location
    - Relations
    - Structure
    - Supply
- Terms renal and nephric from:
    - Latin: ren, and Greek: nephros
