# Learning objectives
###### tags: `MDSA20190 - Renal Biology`

## Physiology
### Renal histology
- Describe structures and functions of human kidneys and urinary tract
- Demonstrate understanding of the homeostatic roles sustained by the kidneys
- Use knowledge of the phenomena and mechanisms occurring in the kidneys and urinary tract to explain the performance of their homeostatic functions and to predict the principal consequences of renal diseases that alter these functions

### Ureter and bladder histology
- Describe structures and functions of the ureters and bladder
- Know histology of the ureters and bladder
- Explain ureteral contraction
- Describe urothelium (transitional epithelium)
- Explain urothelium response to filling/voiding

## Anatomy
### Pelvic cavity, peritoneum and perineum
- Pelvis: bony framework for inferior urinary structures
    - With muscular pelvic walls and floor
- Pelvic cavity: contains urinary, reproductive and excretory organs
- Perinuem: shallow compartment below pelvic floor
- Peritoneum: lining of adbominopelvic cavity and viscera
- Pelvic vessels and nerves

### Gross anatomy of the kidneys and ureters
- Superior urinary system
    - Location
    - Relations
    - Structure
    - Supply
- Terms renal and nephric from:
    - Latin: ren, and Greek: nephros

### Gross anatomy of the urinary bladder and urethra
- Urinary bladder and urethra
    - Location
    - Relations
    - Structure
    - Supply
    - Clinical considerations

### Imaging of the urinary tract
> Determine learning objectives 

### Development of the upper urinary system
- Understand early embryogenesis, formation of blastocyst, implantation (formation of epiblast and hypoblast), gastrulation (formation of ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm)
    - Know how mesoderm differentiates
- Explain development of kidneys and ureters
    - Explain development of the collecting system
    - Explain ascent of the kidneys
- Know of clinical considerations
