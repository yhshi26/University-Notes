2. What is your estimate of their typical diameter?
3. What is the name given to the interconnections labelled B?

### SDL Question 12
1. What type of fluid is normally found in the space labelled A?
2. Can you suggest a reason why the lumen of C is less clearly-defined than the lumen of B?

### SDL Question 13
1. Another view of the renal cortex: structures A and B should now be familiar to you. Estimate their respective diameters.
2. Can you identify any peritubular capillaries, now empty but previously occupied by blood in the living tissue, in this section?

### SDL Question 14
1. Name the blood vessels shown in this section.
2. What type of tissue is in the very narrow band labelled A?

## Questionnaire
### Kidneys:  70. Human. Kidney. H&E stain 
- At low magnification (0.6X magnification), appreciate the granular appearance of the cortex  (outer  region)  and  the  striated  appearance  of  the  medulla  –  why  do  these regions have such distinctive appearances? 
- At  low  magnification  (0.6X  magnification),  distinct  blood  vessels  are  visible  at  the boundary of the cortex and the medulla.  What are these vessels called?  
- How  might  you  identify  interlobular  arteries  and  veins?    Hint:  consider  location, location, location!   
- Many text books refer to interlobular arteries and veins by a different name – do you know what alternative name is used? 
- How can you tell the difference between an interlobular artery and an interlobular vein? Indeed, how can you tell the difference between arteries and veins in general? 
- From  the  cortex,  medullary  rays  are  clearly  visible  (particularly  at  4X  magnification) coursing towards the medulla.  What are these structures? 
- At a 5X magnification, examine the glomeruli of the nephrons.  How can you identify glomeruli  of  cortical  nephrons  and  glomeruli  of  juxtamedullary  nephrons?    Hint: consider location, location, location!   
- Go to a high-power (20X) magnification of the cortex – observe the overall cellularity of the glomerulus.  The nuclei you observe in this region could be those of 3 distinct cell types – can you name these different cells? 
- Note the  thickness  of the  capillary  walls  in  the  glomeruli  –  Hint:  Clear spaces  in  the glomeruli may represent the lumen of capillaries cut transversely.   
- Can you point out the visceral and parietal epithelium of the renal corpuscle?  
- The Bowman's space should be clearly visible to you - what fluid might you expect to find in this region?  What is the essential difference between this fluid and blood? 
- Go  to  a  high-power  (20X)  magnification  of  the  cortex  -  how  can  you  differentiate between proximal convoluted tubules (PCT) and distal convoluted tubules (DCT)?   
- In any given field of view, there are more PCTs visible than DCTs?  Why is this? 
- Be certain that you can identify the Macula Densa cells.  Where are they located and what is the function of these cells? 
- Go  to  a  high-power  (20X)  magnification  of  the  medulla  where  the  numerous  renal tubules  should  be  clearly  visible.    How  many  cells  wide  are  all  of  these  tubules  –consider the functional significance of your answer? 
- How might you distinguish between the cuboidal epithelium of a thick ascending limb (TAL) and the columnar epithelial cells of the collecting ducts? 
- How might you distinguish between the squamous epithelium of a thin limb of the loop of Henle and the squamous endothelium of vasa recta?
 
### Renal Vasculature infused with Carmine Red:  
It is essential that you understand the blood supply of the renal corpuscle, the convoluted tubules, and the loop of Henle, and the functional significance of these. 
- Cortical  and  juxtamedullary  nephrons  have  different  blood  vessels  associated  with them,  which  have  quite  distinct  functions  -  what  are  these  vessels  called  and  what functions would you associate with them? 
- Can you locate interlobular arteries in the slide?  How might you identify them? 
- Can you locate peritubular capillaries in the slide?  How might you identify them? 
- Can you differentiate between afferent and efferent arterioles?  How? 
- Can you identify vasa recta?  These vessels branch off the efferent arterioles of what type of nephrons? 
- Vasa recta enter the medulla and surround which tubules? 
- The blood flow is reduced from cortex (500ml/min per mg tissue) to inner medulla  – (20ml/min per mg tissue) – what do you think is the functional significance of this fact? 
 
### Ureter and Bladder: 
In reality, the different layers of both the bladder and the ureter can be difficult to distinguish from each other. 
 
#### Image 3: 60. Ureter 
- Can you identify and name the two muscle layers in the ureter wall? 
- What structures would you expect to find in the adventitia of the ureter wall? 
- The urothelium of the ureter is made up of 3 different cell types?  What are these called and are you able to identify them in the specimens provided? 
 
#### Image 4:  61. Bladder wall:   
- What is the name given to the smooth muscle found in the wall of the bladder?  Can you identify and name the three muscle layers in the bladder wall? 
- What structures would you expect to find in the adventitia of the bladder wall? 
- Is the following statement true or false - contraction of the bladder wall is stimulated by sympathetic nerve fibres? 
- The urothelium of the bladder and ureter is made up of 3 different cell types?  What are these called and are you able to identify them in the specimens provided?
