## Learning objectives: 
1. Describe structures and functions of human kidneys and urinary tract
2. Demonstrate understanding of the homeostatic roles sustained by the kidneys
3. Use knowledge of the phenomena and mechanisms occurring in the kidneys and urinary tract to explain the performance of their homeostatic functions and to predict the principal consequences of renal diseases that alter these functions

## Urinary (renal) system
The urinary (or renal) system produces and excretes urine. The main components involved include:
- Kidneys → ureters → bladder → urethra

## Kidneys
### Function
The main function of kidneys is maintaining homeostasis. This is done via:
1. Regulating water (fluid volume) and electrolyte balance
    - The output of water in urine depends on intake of water
    - The ouput of different minerals (e.g. sodium, potassium, magnesium, etc.) in urine depends on intake of respective minerals
2. Excretion of metabolic waste (from cellular metabolism) and bioactive substances
    - Metabolic waste can include: urea (from protein), uric acid (from nucleic acids), creatinine (frome muscle creatine), etc.
    - Metabolic waste and bioactive substances must be removed to prevent toxic buildup
3. Regulating arterial blood pressure
    - Regulating blood volume with renin production (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or RAAS)
        - Regulating blood volume regulates blood pressure
4. Regulating erythrocyte (red blood cell) production
    - Kidney is major site of erythropoietin (EPO) production
        - Erythropoietin is released by fibroblast-like cells into the interstitium of the renal cortex and outer medulla when oxygen levels of local tissue is low
        - Erythropoietin stimulates bone marrow to increase erythrocyte production, increasing hemoglobin levels (increasing aerobic respiration)
5. Regulating vitamin D production
    - Active form of vitamin D (calcitriol) is synthesized by kidneys
    - Promotes calcium and phosphate absorption from the gut
    - Rate of synthesis is regulated by hromones that control calcium and phosphate balance
6. Gluconeogensis (glucose synthesis)
    - Synthesis of new glucose molecules from non-carbohydrate sources
    - Occurs during periods of fasting

### Structure
#### External structure
- The renal capsule is a thin membranous sheath that covers the outer surface of each kidney
    - It is composed predominantly of fibrous connective tissue
- The renal capsule is covered by perinephric fat, which is covered by perinephric (perirenal) fascia (which also encloses the adrenal gland which produces aldosterone)
- Each hilum (opening) in each kidney is penetrated by a renal artery, renal vein, lymphatics, renal nerve, and renal pelvis (funnel-shaped upper end of the ureter)

#### Internal structure
- There are 3 distinct regions in the kidney:
    1. The cortex (location of glomeruli of nephrons)
    2. The medulla (predominantly consists of tubules of nephrons)
    3. The renal pelvis (location where the urine collected by major and minor calyces is emptied into)

##### Internal structure histology
- Hematoxylin and eosin staining shows the following:
    - The boundary between the cortex and medulla is clearly delineated
    - The medulla further subdivides into:
        1. Outer medulla (adjacent to the cortex and inner medula)
        2. Inner medulla (adjacent to the outer medulla only)

##### Internal structures
- The internal structure of the kidney involves the following structures:
    - Nephrons are functional units
    - Minor calyces collect urine

##### Nephron structure
- Nephron are functional units of the kidney:
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/CvwRt6e.png =250x)
- Nephrons are composed of:
    1. Renal corpuscles: site of blood filtration
        - Bowman's capsule
        - Glomerulus (fibrous tuft of capillaries held in bowman's space) with the function of maintaining homeostatic pressure
            - By the glomerulus is the juxtaglomerular (next to the glomerulus) apparatus

                - ![](https://i.imgur.com/3xZZRGb.png =350x)
            - The juxtaglomerular apparatus is composed of:
                1. The macula densa (dark spots) of the thick ascending limb
                    - Columnar epithelial cells that act as salt (sodium and chloride) sensors
                2. Extraglomerular (outside the glomerulus) mesangial cells
                    - Specialized smooth muscle cells that regulate blood flow by constricting and relaxing
                3. Granular cells of the afferent arteriole
                    - Specialized smooth muscle cells that manufacture, store and release the hormone renin
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/rDybYNR.png =350x)
    2. Renal tubules
        - Renal tubules are a single layer of epithelial cells composed of (in order):
            - Proximal tubules: simple cuboidal epithelial cells with extended brush border
            - Thin descending and ascending limbs: squamous (flattened epithelium)
            - Thick ascending limb and distal tubule: cuboidal epithelium with invaginated basolateral membranes
            - Collecting duct cells: columnar epithelium, 2 main cell types; principal cells (NaCl reabsorption and K^+^ secretion) and intercalated cells (acid-base balance)

##### Nephron types (2):
1. 85% of nephrons are cortical/superficial nephrons
    - The corpuscle lies in the outer cortex; short loops of henle that barely penetrate the medulla
    - Blood supply: the efferent arteriole taking blood away from the glomerulus enters a capillary entwork called the peritubular capillaries that rejoin  at the interlobular vein
    - Function: reabsorption in kidney
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/mvxkq2B.png =350x)
2. 15% of nephrons are juxtamedullary (next to the medulla) nephrons
    - The corpuscle lies in the inner cortex; long loops of henle deeply penetrate the medulla
    - Blood supply: the efferent arteriole taking blood away from the glomerulus follwos the loop of henle down into the medulla in a set of long loops (vasa recta) that rejoin at the interlobular vein
    - Function: formation of both concentrated and dilute urine

### Summary of renal blood supply
![](https://i.imgur.com/tsh52XW.png =350x)

### Key concepts:
- 6 key functions of kidenys
- Each functional renal unit is composed of a filtering component (glomerulus) and a transporting tubular component (the neprhon and collecting duct)
- There are 2 different categories of nephrons (and their associated vasculature) that have important functional differences
- The cortex receives and enormous volume of blood (glomerular and pertubular capillaries) whereas the vasa recta are the only blood supply to the medulla
- The tubule is made up of a single layer of epithelial cells which differ in structure and funciton along the length of the tubule

### Test understanding questions
1. Is the following statement true or false?  The difference between cortical and juxtamedullary nephrons is that cortical nephrons have their glomeruli in the cortex whereas the glomeruli of juxtamedullary nephrons are in the medulla.
2. If you immunologically labeled cells of the macula densa with label X, and labeled cells of the thick ascending limb with label Y, would you find labels X and Y in the cortex, medulla, or both? 
3. Erythropoietin is secreted by granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus - true or false?
4. Is the following statement true or false? The pars recta and vasa recta constitute different regions of the collecting tubule of the renal tubule.
5. What are the three general types of tubules that occur in the cortical labyrinth and medullary rays of the cortex?

### Histology questions

1. Which region of the kidney is shown?
2. What are the tubules labelled A and B?  In any given field of view, there are more of the former tubules than the latter tubules – why so?
3. Note the close association between tubules and blood vessels. What are these blood vessels called?
