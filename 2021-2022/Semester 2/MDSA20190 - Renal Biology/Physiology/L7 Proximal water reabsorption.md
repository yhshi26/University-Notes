## Test understanding of lecture 6
1. If the concentration of protein in the glomerular filtrate was 0.005g/100ml and none was reabsorbed, how much protein would be excreted per day (assuming a normal GFR)?
2. Which of the following represents the filtered load of calcium given a plasma calcium concentration of 0.095mg/ml and a GFR of 125ml/min?
    A. 13.2mg/min 
    B. 11.8 mg/min
    C. 7.1mg/min
    D. 4.7mg/min
3. Substance X is present in the urine.  Does this prove that it entered the renal tubule by filtration at the glomerulus?
4. The renal clearance for urea is 65 ml/min. What can you infer regarding the renal handling of urea (urea is freely filtered at the glomerulus)?
5. What is the renal clearance of a substance that is freely filtered, not reabsorbed, not secreted?  Give an example of a substance that behaves in this way?
6. A drug is noted to cause a decrease in GFR.  Identify three possible actions of the drug that might decrease GFR. 

## Modification of ultrafiltrate
- Basic renal processes:
    1. Glomerular filtration
    2. Tubular secretion
    3. Tubular reabsorption
- Urinary excretion = filtration + secretion - reabsorption
- Take home message: all along length of nephron are channels and transporters that allow solutes to move between tubule and blood

## Proximal tubular reabsorption
- Microvilli on luminal surface of proximal tubule epithelial cells (indicated by arrows) greatly increases surface area for reabsorption

### What does proximal tubule reabsorb?
- Na^+^ (approximately 65-67%)
- Cl^-^ (approximately 65-67%)
- Glucose (virtually all)
- Protein/amino acids (virtually all)
- HCO~3~^-^ (approximately 80%)
- Urea (approximately 50%)
- K^+^ (approximately 65%)
- Ca^2+^ (approximately 70%)
- Phosphate (approximately 80%)
- Water (absorbed osmotically along with solutes)

### Epithelial barrier
- Take home message: close association between tubules and vasculature
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/tZMCOdY.png =350x)

#### Crossing epithelial barrier: reabsorption
1. Paracellular reabsoprtion: dependent on "leakiness" of tight junctions
2. Transcellular reabsorption: dependent on presence of transporters
- Why do solutes move from lumen into vasculature?
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/r8KzzS2.png =350x)

#### Movement of solutes out of tubule lumen
- Lumen → cell → ISF:
    1. Favorable concentration gradients 
        - Consider Na^+^
    2. Favorable electrochemical gradients
        - Net lumen-negative potential difference across cells
- ISF → vasculature:
    1. Passive diffusion (capillary wall very permeable)
    2. Oncotic pressure
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/1itP57N.png =350x)
- Note: ISF = interstitial fluid, ICF = intracellular fluid

### Basic mechanisms of transmembrane solute transport across epithelial cell
- A lipid bilayer is arranged such that hydrophilic phosphate heads point "out" to water on either side of bilayer and hydrophobic tails point "in" to core of bilayer
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/9q3APYG.png =350x)
- Note: about 5-10% of all human genes code for transport proteins

## Sodium (Na^+^) reabsorption
- Na^+^ is:
    - Freely filtered
    - Actively reabsorbed
        - >99% reabsorbed by renal tubules
    - Not secreted
    - Note: Na^+^ excreted = Na^+^ filtered - Na^+^ reabsorbed
- Na^+^ reabsorbed by different mechanisms in first and second halves of PCT
    - In first half, Na^+^ reabsorbed primarily with bicarbonate (HCO~3~^-^) and glucose
    - In second half, Na^+^ reabsorbed with Cl^-^

### Na^+^-K^+^-ATPase pump: active transport
- Note: in most epithelial cells Na^+^-K^+^-ATPase pump is restricted to basolateral side of cell
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/vB2VDjk.png =350x)

## Na^+^ reabsorption: first half of PCT
![](https://i.imgur.com/SWOebAj.png =350x)

### Electrochemical gradient across epithelial cells of early PCT
- In early proximal tubule, there is a lumen-negative potential difference across cells
- This is created by Na^+^ cotransporters (bringing net positive charge into cell and leaving negative charge in lumen)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/sMDbrGT.png =350x)

## Glucose reabsorption in PCT
- How is glucose reabsorbed in PCT?
    - Filtrate leaving glomerulus has same glucose concentration as plasma: no transepithelial gradient
    - Glucose is a neutral molecule: no electrochemical gradient
    - Glucose uptake is Na^+^ dependent

## Na^+^ and glucose reabsorption: first half of PT
- Note: reabsorption of glucose (and amino acids, phosphate, lactate and most organic solutes) is coupled to Na^+^ reabsorption
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/8sA8LrG.png =350x)

### Tubular [Cl^-^] along length of PCT
- [Cl^-^] in tubular fluid rises due to:
    - More water being reabsorbed than Cl^-^
    - Preferential reabsorption of Na^+^ with HCO~3~^-^ in first half of PCT

## Na^+^ and Cl^-^ reabsorption: second half of PCT
- Second half of PCT: tubular fluid has little glucose and high Cl^-^
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/E38JRvp.png =350x)
- Don't forget: glucose transporters in second half are GLUT1 and SGLT1, whereas the transporters in the first half are GLUT2 and SGLT2

## Sodium (Na^+^) reabsorption
- Mechanisms of Na^+^ movement across apical membrane differ according to location
- Basolateral membrane step is same in all segment that perform Na^+^ reabsorption 
- Note: primary active transport of Na^+^ out of cell by Na^+^/K^+^-ATPase

## Water reabsoprtion in PCT
- Proximal tubule is highly permeable to water
- Both apical and basolateral membranes of PCT express aquaporin water channels
    - Aquaporins are integral membrane pore proteins that selectively conduct water molecules in and out of cell
- Main driving force for water movement across membranes is osmotic pressure
- Water can also move between cells via paracellular route (solvent drag)
- Discussed in more detail in later lectures

### Aquaporin expression in nephron
- Aquaporins are integral membrane pore proteins taht selectively conduct water molecules in and out of cell
- Discussed in more detail in later lectures
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/GCwsbdi.png =350x)

### Solvent drag in PCT
- Solute reabsorption across proximal tubule increases osmolality of interstitial fluid
- Osmotic water flow results in reabsorption of some solutes, especially K^+^, MG^2+^ and Ca^2+^, by a process called "solvent drag" along paracellular routes
- Note: water reabsorption in proximal tubule is not regulated independently of reabsorption of solutes (unlike water reabsorption in distal nephron)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/opGidry.png =250x)

## Protein handling in PCT
- Only a small percentage of proteins are filtered at glomerulus (i.e. ~40mg/L filtered compared to 65-80g/L in plasma)
- But remember large filtering capacity of kidney i.e. 180L/day x 40mg/L = 7.2g protein/day
- Virtually all proteins filtered are reabsorbed in PCT by a process of receptor-mediated endocytosis (also called pinocytosis) 
- This mechanism reabsorbs virtually all proteins filtered, and hence urine is essentially protein free in healthy kidney

### Endocytosis and protein breakdown in PCT
- Plasma proteins become bound to receptor proteins (megalin and cubulin) in coated pits that are present at apical membrane
- Bound proteins are absorbed into tubule cells as endosomes prior to their breakdown by lysosomal enzymes

## Key concepts from lecture
- Reabsorption of water and almost all solutes is linked, directly or indirectly, to active reabsorption of Na^+^
- Flux from lumen to interstitium can be transcellular, using separate transport steps in apical and basolateral membranes, or paracellular, around cells and through tight junctions
- Mechanisms of Na^+^ movement across apical membrane differs according to location, but intracellular Na^+^ levels are kept low by action of the Na^+^-K^+^-ATPase pump expressed on basolateral membrane
- Proximal tubule is highly permeable to water
- Filtered proteins are degraded into their constituent amino acids in PCT and returned to blood

## Test understanding of lecture 7
1. Assume an excessively high filtered load of glucose, and only half is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule.  How much of the remaining half now flowing into the Loop of Henle is reabsorbed from this point on?  A: None,  B: About half,  C: Amount varies with hydration status
2. Na+ is reabsorbed by different mechanisms in the first and second halves of the PCT.  Why?
3. A drug is given that blocks all sodium channels and transporters in the luminal membrane all along the tubule but does not act on the Na^+^-K^+^-ATPase pumps in the basolateral membrane.  What happens to sodium reabsorption?
4. Flux of a solute our of a cell, whether via a uniporter, symporter, or and ATPase, is always a process of active transport (primary or secondary).  True or False?
5. In a canine expt, a dog’s filtered load of Na+ in an isolated pump-perfused kidney is found to be 15mmol/min.  How much Na + would you predict remains in the tubule at the end of the proximal tubule?
