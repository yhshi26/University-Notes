## Excretion of ultra-filtrate
- Pelvis of ureter subdivides in 2 or 3 major calyces each of which then subdivides into 2 or 3 minor calyces
- Minor calyces fit over underlying cone-shaped renal tissue called pyramids (constitutes medulla of kidneys)
- Tip of each pyramid is called a papilla and projects into a minor calyx
- Calyces act as collecting cups for urine formed by renal tissue in  pyramids
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/w1Vv8O8.png =250x)
- Note: major and minor calyces collect ultra-filtrate from collecting ducts of >1 million nephrons per kidney (fluid now called urine) and empty into renal pelvis where it flows to ureter

### Ureteral contraction
- Urine flows from nephron collecting ducts into renal pelves, through ureters (30cm long), to bladder
- When renal calyxes and upper regions of ureters become distended due to urine accumulation, peristaltic contractions occur in ureters that propel urine bolus towards bladder
- Ureteral peristaltic waves originate from electrical pacemakers in  proximal portion of renal pelves
- Urine is then stored in bladder and intermittently ejected: micturition 

### Ureterovesical junction
1. Expandable balloon-like chamber (fundus) comprised of detrusor muscle 
    - Fibres of detrusor muscle orientated in 3 directions, thus retaining structural integrity when stretched
    - Contraction squeezes on urine in bladder lumen to produce micturition
2. Internal urethral sphincter
    - Convergence of detrusor muscle fibres in bladder neck
3. External urethral sphincter
    - Ring of skeletal muscle that can also contract (2-3cm in length)

### Pressure-volume relationship for normal human bladder
- After initial phase of filling, volume increases 3-4-fold with little increase in intra-vesical pressure
- As volume increases further, pressure rises progressively more and more steeply
- Note: bladder capacity related to body size and can be much greater than shown in this diagram

### Neural control of micturition
- Micturition (release of urine from bladder) is coordinated by a combination of smooth and skeletal muscle relaxation and contraction
- Sequential process controlled by:
    - Autonomic nervous system (ANS)
        - Controls smooth (involuntary) muscles i.e. detrusor muscle and internal urethral sphincter
    - Somatic nervous system (SNS)
        - Controls skeletal (also known as striated or voluntary) muscles i.e. external urethral sphincter

### Autonomic nervous system
#### Sympathetic innervation of urinary tract
- SNS promotes continence and relays information to brain about need to void
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/jieURY3.png =550x)
- Sympathetic fibers (shown in green) originate in T11-L2 segments in spinal cord
- Run through hypogastric nerve (HGN) that innervates detrusor and internal urethral sphincter
- Sympathetic postganglionic nerves release noradrenaline
- Noradrenaline activates:
    - β-adrenergic inhibitory receptors in detrusor muscle relax bladder
    - α-adrenergic excitatory receptors in internal urethral sphincter (IUS) cause IUS contraction

#### Parasympathetic innervation of urinary tract
- PNS operates to empty bladder; work synergistically with SNS to control bladder and urethra 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/exer0wg.png =550x)
- Parasympathetic fibers (shown in blue) arise from S2-S4 sacral spinal segments
- Travel in sacral roots and pelvic nerves to ganglia in pelvic plexus (PP) and in bladder wall
- Parasympathetic postganglionic nerves release acetylcholine (ACH), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nitric oxide (NO)
- ACH and ATP activates:
    - M3 muscarinic (ACH) and P2X purinergic (ATP) receptors in detrusor muscle to contract bladder
- NO activates:
    - NO-cGMP-dependent inhibitory receptors on internal urethral smooth muscle sphincter causing relaxation

### Somatic nervous system
#### Somatic innervation of urinary tract
- Somatic nervous system allows conscious control over micturition
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/fpEbcAY.png =450x)
- Cholinergic motor nerves (shown in pink) that supply striated muscles of external urethral sphincter arise in S2–S4 motor neurons in Onuf's nucleus
- Reach periphery through pudendal nerves
- Somatic motor nerves release acetylcholine 
- Acetylcholine activates:
    - Nicotinic receptors in external urethral sphincter causing contraction

## Regulation of bladder filling and voiding
- Neural pathways that control lower urinary tract function are organized as simple on–off switching circuits
- Maintain a reciprocal relationship between urinary bladder and urethral outlet
- Micturition inhibited by activity in hypogastric (sympathetic) nerves and pudendal nerves
    - Reflex mechanisms organized primarily in spinal cord
- Micturition facilitated by activity in pelvic (parasympathetic) nerves
    - Reflex mechanisms organized in brain

### Neural circuits that control continence
#### Storage reflexes
- In a nutshell: as urine accumulates, distention of bladder triggers spinal reflexes resulting in storage of urine
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/uv6KlQJ.png =400x)
1. During storage, progressive bladder distension stimulates afferent nerve fibers of pelvic nerves
2. At low pressures, this activity activates sympathetic fibers of hypogastric nerve
    - Inhibits detrusor muscle contraction (i.e. noradrenaline binding b-adrenergic inhibitory receptors)
    - Contracts IUS (i.e. noradrenaline binding to a-adrenergic excitatory receptors)
3. Strong input by somatic motor neurons via pudendal nerve causes contraction of external urethral sphincter
    - Mediated via acetylcholine binding to nicotinic receptors
4. A region in rostral pons (pontine storage centre) might increase striated urethral sphincter activity

#### Micturition reflex
- In a nutshell: voluntary initiation of voiding reflexes results in activation of micturition center of pons, which signals parasympathetic motor neurons that stimulate contraction of detrusor muscle and relaxation of urinary sphincters
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/OJJ3aQd.png =400x)
1. As urine accumulates, afferent impulses (shown in light blue) enters spinal cord and stimulates parasympathetic outflow (shown in dark blue)
2. Afferent impulses (shown in light blue) also activates pontine micturition centre
    - Results in conscious desire to urinate
3. Parasympathetic efferents stimulate detrusor muscle, opening internal urethral sphincter
    - Contracts detrusor muscle (i.e. M3 muscarinic   (ACH) and P2X purinergic (ATP) receptors)
    - Relaxes IUS (i.e. NO-cGMP-dependent inhibitory receptors)
4. Sympathetic efferents inhibited
5. Somatic efferents inhibited; external urethral sphincter relaxes

## Summary of micturition
Neurological control is complex, with the bladder receiving input from both autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) and somatic arms of the nervous system:
1. Sympathetic nervous system communicates with bladder via  hypogastric nerve (T12 – L2)
    - It causes relaxation of the detrusor muscle
    - These functions promote urine retention
2. Parasympathetic nervous system communicates with bladder via pelvic nerve (S2-S4)
    - Increased signals from this nerve causes contraction of detrusor muscle
    - This stimulates micturition
3. Somatic nervous supply gives us voluntary control over micturition
    - It innervates the external urethral sphincter, via pudendal nerve (S2-S4)
    - It can cause it to constrict (storage phase) or relax (micturition)
4. In addition to efferent nerves supplying bladder, there are sensory (afferent) nerves that report to brain
    - They are found in bladder wall and signal need to urinate when bladder becomes full

## Urinary incontinence
Involuntary loss of urine classified into several types:
- Stress incontinence: accidental loss of urine which occurs when intraabdominal pressure is raised (i.e. sneezing, coughing)
    - Common causes are weakness of bladder neck sphincter, laxity of pelvic floor or damage to external sphincter, e.g. as a result of prostatic surgery or during parturition
- Urge incontinence: involuntary loss of urine occurring immediately need to void is noticed
    - Causes include urinary tract infections and detrusor overactivity during bladder filling (which can be caused by urinary tract stones)
- Overflow incontinence: bladder full to capacity, and urine then leaks out of urethra
    - Causes include outlet obstruction (e.g. an enlarged prostate gland, faecal impaction or urethral stricture) and underactive detrusor muscle 
- Total incontinence: no voluntary control over voiding
    - May be congenital or caused by neurological damage or disease (e.g. paraplegia, multiple sclerosis)
- Functional incontinence: normal bladder function but intellectual impairment or immobility prevents patient from reaching the toilet

## Lecture summary
- Normal voiding occurs in response to afferent signals of bladder filling, and it is controlled by nervous system of brain and spinal cord
- Interactions between autonomic (mediated by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves) and somatic (mediated by pudendal nerves) efferent pathways
- Sympathetic innervation arises in thoracolumbar outflow of spinal cord, whereas parasympathetic and somatic innervation originates in sacral segments of spinal cord
- Micturition is an automatic spinal cord reflex, triggered by filling of bladder to a critical pressure; however, reflex can be inhibited or facilitated by higher centres in brain stem and cerebral cortex
