## Learning objectives
- How does maintenance of volume of body compartment/s occur?
- What causes a shift in volume of body compartment/s?

## Fluid compartments in body
- 2 primary fluid compartments in body
    1. Intracellular fluid compartment (ICF)
    2. Extracellular fluid compartment (ECF)
        - Interstitial fluid compartment
        - Intravascular fluid compartment
        - Transcellular fluid compartment 
            - (cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, serous fluids (i.e. peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid), intraocular fluid)
- Different compartments have different fluid composition
- Volume of a given compartment is determined by amount of solutes within that compartment

## Disturbances of body fluid balance
- Oedema: abnormal accumulation of fluid beneath the skin, or in 1+ cavities of the body
    - A: severe lymphoedema
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/qk1hdSM.png =100x)
    - B: severe protein malnutrition
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/BvtwtcK.png =100x)
    - C: systemic (pitting) oedema in the lower parts of body particularly in the ankles 
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/gVtXfRh.png =100x)
- Dehydration scenarios:
    - Vomiting and diarrhoea
    - Severe haemorrhage
- Over-hydration scenarios:
    - Psychogenic polydipsia
    - Infusion therapy
- Note: only regulated route for excretion of fluid from body is via kidneys

## Fluid in body
- 60% male body weight is water
    - Standard male is 70kg: 42 litres of H~2~O
- 55% female body weight is water
    - Standard female is 55kg: 30 litres of H~2~O

### Fluid volumes in body compartments
- Note: information of weight allows estimation of volume
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/wSKLcXA.png =450x)

### Measuring volumes of body compartments
- Plasma compartment tracers:  Evan’s blue or radio-iodinated serum albumin (RISA)
- Extracellular compartment tracers:  mannitol or inulin 
- Total body volume tracers:  tritium oxide (THO)
- Volumes of interstitial (ISF) and intracellular fluid (ICF) measured indirectly
    - i.e.  ISF = ECF minus Plasma; 
        - ICF = Whole body volume minus ECF 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/2KWdri5.png =450x)

#### Measuring blood volume
- Note: plasma water is initial body access point for ingested nutrients, and exit point for body’s waste products; access to all cells of body, except cells of blood, is via interstitial space
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Pge52fh.png =450x)

#### Water intake and output
- Note: body maintains steady-state water balance by ensuring that amount of water added each day is exactly balanced by that lost or excreted; only regulated route for excretion of water from body is via kidneys; urine volume can vary from 0.5-1.8L/day
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/2MBc89J.png =450x)

## How kidneys regulate water excretion
- Water diffuses across plasma membrane of most cells via water channels known as aquaporins
- Type and number of aquaporins differ in different cell membranes
- Type and number of aquaporins in a cell membrane can be altered in response to various signals i.e. anti-diuretic hormone (ADH)
- Collecting tubules of kidney nephrons express numerous aquaporins that can be increased or decreased in number depending on the total body water content
    - Dehydration → high expression of aquaporins in tubules (water reabsorbed to blood, low water loss in urine)
    - Overhydration → low expression of aquaporins in tubules (excess water excreted in urine)
- Discussed in detail in lectures 6-8

## Movement between body fluid compartments
- Differing compositions of compartments reflect activities of barriers (cell membranes) separating them
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/R08wAWW.png =450x)

### Movement between intracellular fluid and interstitial fluid
- Most substances that are biologically important cannot penetrate lipid membranes
- To cross a cell plasma membrane, most substances must move through specific integral membrane proteins which are divided into channels or transporters
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/sw1w8BE.png =350x)

### Movement between body fluid compartments
- Main drivers of solute movement between intracellular and interstitial fluid compartments are:
    - Osmotic pressure
    - Electrochemical gradients
- Main drivers of solute movement between interstitial and plasma compartments are:
    - Hydrostatic pressure
    - Oncotic pressure
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/S8tJnJR.png =350x)

#### Osmotic pressure (π)
- Osmotic pressure of a solution = pressure that must be applied to a solution to prevent net flow of water into it
- Note: water "flows" osmoles
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/pYmccnT.png =450x)

#### Electrochemical gradient
- Virtually all eukaryotic cells maintain a nonzero transmembrane potential
- Note: separation of electrical charge across a plama membrane (membrane potential) provides electrical force that drives positive ions (+) into a cell and negative ions (-) out of a cell
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ao5kEGg.png =350x)

#### Hydrostatic and oncotic pressure
- Hydrostatic pressure: (red arrow)
    - Pressure exerted by a fluid at equilibrium due to force of gravity, pumping of hear: fluid "learks out" of capillaries
- Oncotic pressure: (blue arrow)
    - Large plasma proteins cannot cross capillary wall sand tend to pull water into capillaries
    - Albumin (main protein compoennt of blood) constitutes ~80% of total oncotic pressure exerted by blood plasma on interstitial fluid (recall image of child with severe protein malnutrition earlier in lecture)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/5bDCkir.png =200x)

#### Oncotic pressure 
- Oncotic pressure = a type of osmotic pressure, generated by impermeable proteins in solution (Gibbs-Donnan effect)
- Note: each side remains electrically neutral within itself
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/CGs3Gji.png =450x)

## Composition of fluid compartments
- Osmotic pressure of a body fluid: generally expressed as its osmolality i.e. moles total solute/solvent mass (kg)
- Note: water distribution in body compartments depends primarily on conc.^ion^ of electrolytes in body compartments
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/TiXX1aW.png =450x)

### Tonicity: fluctuations in cell volume
- Tonicity of a solution: related to its effect on volume of cell
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/pAY0VTl.png =450x)

### Ineffective vs effective osmoles
- An ineffective osmole is a substance that, although osmotically active, can easily distribute across body compartments and so does not cause fluid shifts i.e. urea
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Xx23tlJ.png =450x)

## Dehydration states
- Fluid loss can be due to a variety of reasons:
    - Skin: burns, large wounds
    - Gastrointestinal tract: diarrhea, vomiting
    - Kidney: polyuria, diuretics
    - Haemorrhage, oedema, etc.
- Dehydration states:
    - Isosmotic dehydration
    - Hyperosmotic dehydration
    - Hypoosmotic dehydration

### Isosmotic dehydration
- Causes: blood loss (hemorrhage), diarrhea and vomiting, burns
    - Hint: gastrointestinal fluids (i.e. feces and vomit) are isotonic
- Note: water does not move between body compartments if osmolality stays same
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/RjDgSr3.png =450x)

### Hyperosmotic dehydration
- Loss of water in excess of solut
- Causes: low water intake, diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, fever
    - Hint: sweat is hypotonic (loss of water in excess of salt)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/LpzLDH5.png =450x)

### Hyposmotic dehydration
- Loss of solute in excess of water
- Causes: renal loss of NaCl due to adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/pb716Z7.png =450x)

## Summary
- Compartmentalization of body fluids is an important general principle in physiology
- Compartmentalization is achieved by barriers between compartements; these barriers determine which substances move between compartements
- Solutes and water that enter or leave body do so via ECF
- ICF and ECF are in osmotic balance; water moves between these compartments only when osmotic pressure gradients exists
- Equilibration of ICF and ECF osmolality occurs primarily by shifts in water and not shifts in solute
- Loss of isotonic solution does not alter intracellular fluid (ICF) volume, loss of hypertonic soln will tend to contract ICF, loss of hypotonic soln will tend to expand ICF

## Test understanding of lecture
1. A woman runs the Dublin city marathon on a very hot day and loses 3 litres of sweat (hypotonic). During marathon, she drinks 3 litres of water. For each parameter listed below, indicate whether it is increased, decreased, or unchanged in new steady state, and clearly explain why.
a) Plasma osmolality
b) Extracellular fluid volume
c) Hematocrit
d) Total body water
2. Consider following 3 over-hydration scenarios and determine what happens to volumes of ECF and ICF compartments?

### Overhydration states
#### Isosmotic overhydration
- Cause: oral/parenteral administration of large volumes of isotonic NaCl solution (0.9% NaCl, 290 mOsm)
- What happens to volumes of ECF and ICF compartments?
- Note: water does not move if osmolality stays same
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/uuDVUsZ.png =250x)

#### Hyperosmotic overhydration
- Cause: oral/parenteral administration of hypertonic NaCl solution (3.0% NaCl, 1000 mOsm)
- What happens to volumes of the ECF and ICF compartments?
- Note: wayer "follows" osmoles
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/97KamFE.png =250x)

#### Hypoosmotic overhydration
- Causes: oral/parenteral administration of hypotonic NaCl solution (0.45% NaCl, 145 mOsm); ingestion of large volumes of water (water intoxication), retention of water by kidney (SIADH = syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH)
- Note: water "follows" osmoles
