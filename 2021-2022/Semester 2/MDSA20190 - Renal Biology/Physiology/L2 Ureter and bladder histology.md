## Lecture 1 review
1. Blood is filtered at the glomeruli of nephrons and enters the nephron tubules (now called ultrafiltrate)
2. The ultrafiltrate is modified as it moves through the renal cortex and renal tissue called pyramids (constitutes the medulla of the kidneys)
3. The tip of each pyramid is called a papilla and projects into a minor calyx; the minor calyces act as collecting cups for the urine formed by the renal tissue in the pyramids
4. The urine next moves into the major calyces and exits the kidney at the renal pelvis

Key concept: the minor and major calyces collect the ultra-filtrate from the collecting ducts of >1 million nephrons per kidney (fluid now called urine) and empty it into the renal pelvis where it flows into the ureter

## Ureters and bladder
- The ureters and bladder comprise a major component of the urinary tract (all lined by urothelium)
    - Ureters: muscular tubes (30cm long) that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder
    - Bladder: expandable muscular sac that stores urine prior to micturition

### Ureteral contraction
- Urine flows from the nephron collecting ducts into renal pelvis through ureters to the bladder
- The urine bolus is propelled by a wave of perstalsis along the ureter
- Ureteral peristaltic waves originate from electrical pacemakers in the proximal portion of the renal pelvis; stretch promotes pacemaker activity
- Urine is then stored in the bladder and intermittently ejected (micturition)
    - The neural circuitry that controls micturition is complex and highly distributed

### Ureter cross section
#### Cross section 1
- Adventitia (A)
    - Contains blood vessels (V)
    - Lymphatics and nerves
- Muscular region
    - Outer circular layer (\C)
    - Inner longitudinal layer (L)
    - Third layer present in distal ureter (outer longitudinal)
- Lamina propria (LP)
    - Loose connective tissue
- Lumen lined by urothelium
    - Transitional epithelium

#### Cross section 3
- This section shows the lamina propria (connective tissue)
    - Inter-dispered with small blood vessels
    - Varied cell population present i.e. fibroblasts, lymphocytes, etc.
- Multilayered urothelium
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/YPrgSme.png =250x)

### Urothelium (transitional epithelium)
- Urothelium is specific to the urinary outflow system
    - Lines the inner surface of the renal pelvis, the ureters, and the urinary bladder
    - Forms a robust permeability barrier; is coated with an organized array of uroplakin molecules
- Features intermediate (hence transitional) between stratified cuboidal and stratified squamous epithelia
- Forms a tight barrier that allows for retention of urine, highly expansive

#### Urothelium (transitional epithelium) histology
- 5-6 cell layers when unstretched
- Basal layers cuboidal
    - 10 micrometers, single layer
- Intermediate layers columnar
    - Pyriform in shape, 10-25 micrometers, several layers
- Surface layer large polyhedral cells known as umbrella cells or dome cells (25-250 micrometers)

##### Cross section 1
- Urothelium in a ureter
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ku6fDBe.png =250x)

##### Cross section 2
- Urothelium in bladder
- Umbrella cells are interconnected by tight junctions and their apical membrane contain impermeable plaques of uroplakin proteins (80-90% of the surface)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZA4vF5l.png =250x)

### Uterovesical junction
- Bladder consists of 2 principal parts:
    1. Fundus
    2. Bladder neck or posterior urethra (2-3 cm long)
- Ureters enter the bladder obliquely and run submucosally; this arrangement closes end of ureters when pressure within bladder rises
- Normally prevents vesicoureteral reflux (a hereditary disease that affects 0.5-1% of the population)

### Bladder cross section
#### Cross section 1
- Urothelium
- Lamina propria
- Detrusor muscle:
    - 3 smooth muscle layers:
        1. Inner longitudinal 
        2. Outer circular
        3. Outer longitudinal
- Adventitia contains blood vessels, lymphatics and nerves
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/vIxdYNq.png =250x)

#### Cross section 2
- Layers of detrusor muscle frequently difficult to discern in histological preparations
- Lamina propria (LP)
- Adventitia (A)

### Urothelium response to bladder filling/voiding
- Increased urine volume accommodated by urothelium in 2 ways:
    1. Unfolding of the mucosal surface
    2. CHanges in morphology (size and shape) of cells
- Results in surface area of the bladder increasing

#### Cross section 1
- Relaxed urothelium:
    1. Folded mucosal surface
    2. Urothelium 5-6 cells thick (note the larger rounded umbrella cells)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/KK8w3Rk.png =250x)

#### Cross section 2
- Strecthed urothelium:
    1. Unfolded mucosal surface
    2. Urothelium 1-2 cells thick (squamous)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/PI5Gos2.png =250x)

#### Surface specializations at apical surface of umbrella cell
- Apical membrane of umbrella cells has unique lipid and protein composition
- Apical surface covered by raised ridges called hinges (marked by arrows) and intervening areas called plaques (scalloped appearance)
    - Plaques (composed of uroplakin proteins) occupy approximately 70=90% of the usrface of the umbrella cell
- Outer leaflet of the membrane associated with the plaque regions twice as thick as inner leaflet, thus forming an asymmetric unit membrane (AUM) (arrowhead)
- The membrane associated with the hinge and plaque regions is highly detergent insoluble
    - May reflect the unusual lipid composition of the membrane, which is rich in cholesterol, phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and cerebroside; overall a lipid profile similar to myelin

    - A: hinge areas are marked with arrows; the intervening areas of plasma membranes are plaques; the boxed area is magnified in panel B
    - Apical cytoplasm of rat umbrella cells has disc-shaped (*) and fusiform-shaped (f) vesicles
    - B: high magnification view of asymmetric unit membrane (AUM); hinges are marked with arrows, and a plaque with readily identifiable AUM is marked with an arrowhead

#### Models for vesicle dynamics in umbrella cells
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/lsocGJV.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/wzQyOe7.png =250x)
- Classical model: 
    - Filling stimulates exocytosis of vesicles (increases surface area)
    - Voiding associated with endocytosis; re-establishes the vesicle population
- Revised model:
    - Filling stimulates endocytosis and exocytosis of vesicles; net rate such that membrane is added to the apical surface
    
### Key lecture concepts
- Ureters and urinary bladder share similar histological features:
    - Urothelium
    - Lamina propria
    - Smooth muscle
- Entire apical surface of umbrella cell composed of 2 lipid raft subdomains: plaques and hinges
- Urothelium is a highly impermeable but flexible membrane
- Mechanical stimuli such as pressure alter exocytic and endocytic traffic in umbrella cells thus altering surface area
