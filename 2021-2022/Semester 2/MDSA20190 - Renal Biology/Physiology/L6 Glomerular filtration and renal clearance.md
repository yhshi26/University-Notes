# Glomerular filtration
## Urine formation
- Urine formation begins with filtration of plasma from glomerular capillaries into Bowman's space
- This process is termed glomerular filtration and filtrate is called glomerular filtrate or ultra-filtrate
- Selectivity of filtration barrier determined by:
    1. Molecular size of intravascular components
    2. Electrical charge of filtration barrier components (3 layers, all negatively charged)

### Glomerular filtration barrier
1. Capillary endothelium (fenestrae 70-100nm)
    - Filled with negatively charged glycoprotein, mostly podocalyxin
2. Basement membrane
    - Collagen, protoeglycans, glycoproteins (laminin, fibronectin)
    - Physical barrier, electrostatic repulsion
3. Filtration slits of 25-65nm (bridged by slit diaphragms composed of nephrin) are key selective barrier in filtration
- Note: glomerular filtration barrier determines composition of plasma ultrafiltrate

### Scanning EM of podocyte
- With their primary and secondary foot processes, podocytes enwrap entire surface of glomerular capillaries
- This complex cellular architecture is crucial for integrity of renal filtration barrier

### Glomerular filtration barrier

    1. Molecular size of intravascular components
    2. Electrical charge of filtration barrier compoents

## Composition of ultrafiltrate
- Most ions and low molecular weight components (<7kDa) are freely filtered
- Almost total exclusion of larger plasma proteins such as albumin (~66kDa)
- Amount filtered between 7 – 66kDa becomes progressively smaller as the molecules become larger
- Exclusion of substances bound to large plasma proteins (i.e. 40% of Ca^2+^ is not filtered as bound to large plasma proteins) 
- Negatively charged macromolecules are filtered to a lesser extent, and positively charged macromolecules to a greater extent, than neutral molecules
- Note: glomerular filtration barrier determines composition of plasma ultrafiltrate

### Modification of ultrafiltrate
- Basic renal processes:
    1. Glomerular filtration
    2. Tubular secretion
    3. Tubuler reabsorption
    - Urinary excretion = filtration + secretion - reabsorption
- Take home message: all along length of nephron are channels and transporters that allow solutes to move between tubule and blood
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/WtenGXG.png =350x)

## Values for renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular flow rate (GFR)
- Typical renal blood flow (RBF): kidneys receive 20% (1.1L/min) of total cardiac output (5.5L/min)
- Typical renal plasma flow (RPF) = 605mL/min*
    - Normal HCT is ~45%, which implies that ~55% of blood volume is plasma; therefore, 1.1L of plasma X 0.55 = 605mL/min
- Typical glomerular filtration rate (GFR) = 125mL/min (or 180L/day)
- Most reabsorbed (124mL/min) with average excretion rate of urine ~1mL/min (or ~ 1.5L/day) 
- Note: with a plasma volume ~3L (see lecture 1), entire plasma volume is filtered 60 times daily

### Factors influencing GFR across glomerular capillaries
- Equation has a number of important physiologic implications, expecially when pathologic processes grossly alter one or more of the variables
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/iKAOYBD.png =450x)

#### Membranous nephropathy
- Characterized by diffuse thickening of glomerular capillary basement membrane by subepithelial immune complex deposition
- This results in damage and increased permeability of basement membrane to plasma proteins and hence nephrotic range proteinuria
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/L0h8rkm.png =250x)

### Filtered load
- The total amount of any substance freely filtered from renal glomerular capillaries into Bowman’s space is called filtered load and can be calculated by:
    - Filtered load of substance X = GFR x [X] in plasma
- Example: [Glucose] in plasma is 1g/L and typical GFR is 180L/day 
    - Filtered load of glucose = 180L/day x 1g/L = 180g/day
- If quantity of a substance excreted in urine is less that filtered load, tubular reabsorption must have occurred
- If quantity of a substance excreted in urine is greater that filtered load, tubular secretion must have occurred. 
- Question: how might GFR be altered?

### Control of GFR: constriction and dilation of afferent arterioles and efferent arterioles are major players in altering GFR
![](https://i.imgur.com/opdHLlI.png =450x)

### Why maintaining glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is important
- Important for kidneys to keep GFR at a level appropriate for body because excretion of salt and water is strongly influenced by GFR
- GFR is strongly influenced by renal arterial pressure 
    - A rise in blood pressure causes an increased excretion of salt and water, a process called pressure natriuresis
    - A fall in blood pressure diminishes excretion 
- These changes in excretion are mediated partly via changes in GFR

### Autoregulation of renal blood flow (RBF) and glomeruar flow rate (GFR)
- Kidneys regulate their blood flor by adjusting vascular resistance in response to change in arterial pressure
- Note: kidney has control mechanisms in place that keep RBF (and therefore GFR) relatively constant as arterial blood pressure increases between 90 and 180 mmHg
- Question: what mechanisms are responsible for regulating RBG and GFR?
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/TqXutpz.png =450x)

### Mechanisms responsible for regulation of RBF and GFR
1. Myogenic mechanism
    - Vascular smooth muscle tends to contract when stretched
    - Very fast acting; protects from short-term fluctuations in blood pressure
2. Tubuloglomerular feedback
    - Macula densa cells act as salt sensors; sense [NaCl] in tubular fluid (filtrate)
    - High levels of Na^+^ flowing past macula densa cells cause a decrease in GFR (by afferent arteriole constriction)
- Note: both factors regulate tone of afferent arteriole
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Nfl6VO0.png =250x)

#### Myogenic mechanism
1. When blood pressure increases across afferent arteriole, smooth muscle cell (SMC) membrane is stretched inward (black arrows), which opens stretch activated Ca^2+^ (and Na^+^) channels
2. Ca^2+^ (and Na^+^) enters SMC which depolarizes cells i.e. becomes less negative
3. Depolarization of cells opens voltage-gated Ca^2+^ channels (on sacroplasmic reticulum), Ca^2+^ levels increase in intracellular space and bind actin chains of  myofilaments
4. Actin binding causes myofilaments to contract (green arrows), opposing stretch of cell membrane caused by elevated BP and thus maintain a steady RBF and GFR.
- Note: regulates tone of afferent arteriole by intrinsic adjustments in tension of vascular SMCs

#### Tubuloglomerular feedback
Cellular mechanism of tubuloglomerular feedback:
1. Increase in GFR elevates [NaCl] in tubule fluid at macula densa (MD)
2. Enhanced uptake of NaCl across MD cells via NKCC2 channel leading to increased [ATP] and [adenosine] (ADO)
3. ATP binds P2X receptors and ADO binds adenosine A1 receptors on smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of afferent arteriole
4. Receptor binding results in an increase in [Ca^2+^] in SMCs
5. Increase in [Ca2+] induces vasoconstriction of afferent arteriole, GFR decreases
- Note: Elevated levels of ATP and ADO also inhibit renin release from granular cells (discussed in lecture 9)

### Other factors that affecr GFR and RBF
- Sympathetic nerves:
    - AA and EA are innervated by sympathetic neurons
    - Norepinephrine and epinephrine cause vasoconstriction by binding a1-adrenoceptors (located mainly on AA)
- Vasoactive factors
    - Angiotensin 2:  produced systemically and locally; constricts AA and EA; EA more sensitive to ANG2
    - Endothelin:  vasoconstrictor produced by ECs, mesangial cells and DCT cells; causes vasoconstriction of AA and EA
    - Nitric oxide:  vasodilator produced by ECs, macula densa and SMCs; counteracts vasoconstriction of ANG2 and sympathetic input i.e. vasodilation of AA and EA
    - Prostaglandins:  vasodilator produced locally in kidney by ANG2 stimulation; counteracts vasoconstriction of ANG2 and sympathetic input

## Key concepts from filtration lecture
- GFR varies with net filtration pressure and capillary filtration coefficient
- Net filtration pressure is determined by renal artery pressures, resistance in afferent and efferent arterioles, and plasma oncotic pressures
- Kidney has autoregulatory mechanisms that alter changes in renal blood flow and GFR in response to changes in renal artery pressures
- Several factors and hormones can profoundly affect GFR and RBF

# Renal clearance
## How RBF and GFR are measured
- Renal function is quantified in terms of clearance
- Renal clearance of any substance is volume of plasma from which that substance is completely removed (“cleared”) by kidneys per unit time
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/V7iAyxt.png =400x)

## Basic renal processes
- Basic renal processes (3):
    1. Filtration
    2. Reabsorption
    3. Secretion
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZS3SB0R.png =450x)
- Note: knowledge of how different substances are handled by renal tubules allows us to estimate RPF and GFR

### Case 1: substance x is freely filtered, not reabsorbed, fully secreted
- Para-aminohippurate (PAH) is a small (MW 194Da) water soluble organic anion that is administered intravenously
- PAH is freely filtered, not reabsorbed, fully secreted
- Therefore, excreted amount of PAH equals amount that entered kidney via renal artery i.e.:
    - Renal plasma flow x P~PAH~ = U~PAH~ x V
    - Therefore, RPF = (U~PAH~ x V)/P~PAH~ = C~PAH~
- Note: clearance of PAH equals renal plasma flow i.e. ~605ml/min
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/3yO7OOn.png =150x)

### Case 2: substance y is freely filtered, not absorbed, not secreted
- Inulin is a biologically inert polyfructose(MW 5kDa) that is administered intravenously
- Inulin is freely filtered and not reabsorbed, secreted, synthesized or metabolized by kidney
- Filtered load of inulin is equal to mass of inulin excreted:
    - GFR x P~inulin~ = U~inulin~ x V
    - Therefore, GFR = (U~inulin x V)/P~inulin~ = C~inulin~
- Note: clearance of a substance neither reabsorbed nor secreted, just filtered, equals GFR - ~125ml/min
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/19Q4Q8u.png =150x)

### Case 3: substance z is freely filtered, fully reabsorbed, not secreted
- If a substance is freely filtered into Bowman’s capsule but is fully reabsorbed by peritubular capillaries (and not secreted), filtrate (urine) will contain none of substance
- Renal clearance = 0ml/min
- Glucose and amino acids behave in this manner
- Note: if glucose is present in urine immediately suspect renal disease or very high blood glucose levels such as in untreated diabetes mellitus
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/kV01Ejq.png =150x)

## Renal clearance of creatinine
- Gold standard for measuring GFR is inulin whereas creatinine clearance is used for routine GFR assessment
- Creatinine is waste product released by muscle; its production is relatively constant
- Freely filtered, not reabsorbed but small amount is secreted by proximal tubule *
    - * A small amount of creatinine is secreted, therefore creatinine clearance is slightly higher than GFR; secreted fraction is normally about 10-20% of what is excreted, so measured creatinine clearance overestimates GFR by same percentage; for routine assessment of GFR, this degree of error is acceptable 
- Measure creatinine by urine collection  (generally 24hr) plus a blood sample taken during collection period
    - C~Cr~ = (U~Cr~ x V)/P~Cr~

### Relationship between GFR and plasma creatinine conc.^ion^
- Although creatinine clearance is a valuable clinical measure of GFR, it is far more common to measure plasma creatinine and use this as indicator of GFR
- A normal person’s creatinine concentration is ~1mg/dL
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/zCC0G6D.png =450x)
- Note: a rising plasma creatinine is a strong indicator of renal disease

## Key concepts from clearance lecture
- Renal clearance of any substance x is quantified by a general clearance formula relating urine flow to urine and plasma concentrations: 
    - C~x~ = (U~x~ x V)/P~x~
- PAH clearance is used as an estimate of RPF i.e. ~605ml/min
- Inulin clearance can be used to get a very accurate measure of GFR i.e. ~125ml/min
- Creatinine clearance is used as a practical estimate of GFR 
    - A small amount of creatinine is secreted, therefore creatinine clearance is slightly higher than GFR
- Plasma [creatinine] is used as an indicator of GFR; a steadily increasing plasma [creatinine] is a strong indicator of renal disease

    C. 7.1mg/min
    D. 4.7mg/min
3. Substance x is present in urine. Does this prove that it entered renal tubule by filtration at glomerulus?
4. Renal clearance for urea is 65 ml/min. What can you infer regarding renal handling of urea (urea is freely filtered at glomerulus)?
