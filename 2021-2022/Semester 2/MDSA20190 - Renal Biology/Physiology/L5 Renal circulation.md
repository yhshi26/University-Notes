## Test understanding of last lecture

1. 2016-2017 MDSA20190 re-sit essay exam:
    - A woman runs the Dublin city marathon on a very hot day and loses 3 litres of sweat (hypotonic). During the marathon, she drinks 3 litres of water. For eachparameter listed below, indicate whether it is increased, decreased, or unchanged in the new steady state, and clearly explain why.

    a) Plasma osmolality
    b) Extracellular fluid volume
    c) Hematocrit
    d) Total body water

2. Consider the following 3 hydration scenarios and determine what happens to the volumes of the ECF and ICF compartments?

## Overhydration
### Isosmotic overhydration
- Cause: oral/parenteral administration of large volumes of isotonic NaCl solution (0.9% NaCl, 290 mOsm)
- What happens to volumes of ECF and ICF compartments?
- Note: water does not move if osmolality stays same

### Hyperosmotic overhydration
- Cause: oral/parenteral administration of hypertonic NaCl solution (3.0% NaCl, 1000 mOsm)
- What happens to volumes of ECF and ICF compartments?
- Note: water "follows" osmoles
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/yR5PRDP.png =250x)

### Hypoosmotic overhydration
- Cause: oral/parenteral administration of hypotonic NaCl solution (0.45% NaCl, 145 mOsm); ingestion of large volumes of water (water intoxication), retention of water by kidney (SIADH)
- What happens to volumes of ECF and ICF compartments
- Note: water "follows" osmoles

## Renal circulation
### Distribution of systemic blood flow at rest
- Kidney is a highly vascular organ receiving approximately 20% of cardiac output
- Renal blood flow ~950 – 1100 ml/min (20% of cardiac output)
- If normalized to tissue weight blood flow to kidney is 7x higher than blood flow to brain
- This blood flow to kidneys is far in excess of kidneys’ metabolic needs

### Renal blood vessels
- Note: nephron not drawn to scale
- Ateries are accompanied by corresponding veins (not shown)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/kAUlOc7.png =350x)

### Renal blood supply
#### Cortical nephrons 
- Function: cortical nephrons are responsible for msot of reabsoprtion that occurs within kidney; glomeruli in outer cortex
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/njDQINP.png =350x)

#### Juxtamedullary nephrons
- Function: juxtamedullary neprhons are involving producing concentrated urine; glomeruli are in inner cortex, near medulla

## Summary of renal blood supply
![](https://i.imgur.com/3QhwqeV.png =550x)

### Capillary beds in kidney
- As blood flows through glomerulus, about 20% of plasma filters into Bowman's capsule (rather low)
- Most of blood (>85-90%) continues on to peritubular capillaries in cortex
- Much smaller fraction (5-10%) flows down into medulla
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/y5AF1Ak.png =450x)

### Values for renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular flow rate (GFR)
- Typical renal blood flow (RBF): kidneys receive 20% (1.1L/min) of total cardiac output (5.5L/min)
- Typical renal plasma flow (RPF) = 605mL/min*
    - * Normal HCT is ~55% of blood volume is plasma; therefore, 1.1 L of plasma x 0.55 = 605mL/min
- Typical glomerular filtration rate (GFR) = 125mL/min (or 180L/day)
- Most reabsorbed (124mL/min) with average excretion rate of urine ~1mL/min (or ~1.5L/day)
- Note: with a plasma volume ~3L (see lecture 4) entire plasma volume is filtered 60 times daily

## Renal blood supply
- Note: reduced blood flow from cortex to inner medulla is crucial to prevent hyperosmolar gradient in medullary interstitium from being washed away (lecture 10)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/da1XMmT.png =350x)
    - 90% of blood which enters kidney (via renal artery) supplies renal cortex
        - Cortical blood flow: 500 ml/min per 100 g tissue
    - Cortical blood passes to medulla
        - Outer medulla blood flow: 100 ml/min per 100 g tissue
        - Inner medulla blood flow: 20 ml/min per 100 g tissue

### Crossing capillary "barrier"
- In cortex (peritutular capillaries)
    - Endothelium is fenestrated and underlying basement memrbane is loose
        - Overall transport governed almost exclusively by events in tubular epithelium
- In medulla (vasa recta)
    - Only some regions of vascular endothelium are fenestrated
        - Overall transport depends on properties of both vascular endothelium and tubular epithelium
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/fMhyqT3.png =250x)

## Overview of capillaries
- Capillaries (single thin layer of endothelial cells surrounded by a basement membrane) are principal site for exchange of gases, nutrients, water and waste products
- Diffusion of small, water-soluble solutes across capillary wall depends on permeability and concentration gradient
- Filtration is a second proecss taking place across capillaries
- Hydrostatic pressure (blood pressure) differences between capillary and interstitial fluid drive filtration (out of capillary)
- Differences in protein concentration between capillary and interstitial fluid result in oncotic pressure differences that oppose moment of capillary fluid into interstitial space

## Net filtration pressure
- Starling forces: 4 factors determine net filtration pressure (NFP)
- Note: if NFP is a positive value then net fluid movement out of capillaries, if NFP is a negative value then net fluid movement in to capillaries
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/sSnc9QY.png =350x)

### Imbalances in starline pressures result in edema
- In some pathophysiological circumstances, imbalances in starling forces can lead to edema:
    - Heart failure: elevated venous pressure "backs blood up" into capillaries; elevated hydrostatic pressure (P~CAP~) causes excess filtration
    - Injury (ankle sprain): release of chemical factors locally within injured tissues can 1. dilate arterioles, increasing P~CAP~ and filtration and 2. cause endothelial cells to distort, plasma proteins move to interstitium, increases π~IF~, increase filtration
    - Abnormal decrease in plasma protein concentration: liver disease (decreases plasma protein production), kidney disease (loss of protein in urine), protein malnutrition (compromises manufacture of plasma proteins); all reduce π~CAP~

### Fall in mean BP from ateries to capillaries: typical (non-renal) vascular bend
- Estimated forces in non-renal vascular beds in humans
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/pSZ7mWb.png =450x)

### Net filtration pressure in typical renal vascular bed
- Along glomerular capillaries, hydrostatic pressure (P~CAP~) at arteriole end is high relative to non-renal vascular beds i.e. ~ 53mmHg
- Furthermore, P~CAP~ decreases only slightly along length of glomerular capillaries to ~50mmHg
    - Fluid filtration occurs along their length
- In peritubular capillaries, P~CAP~ (15mmHg) is lower than plasma oncotic pressure so fluid reabsorption occurs along their length
- In a renal vascular bed, why is P~CAP~ at afferent arterioles so high?

### Why is hydrostatic pressure at afferent arterioles high relative to non-renal vascular beds?
1. Presence of second set of arterioles after glomerular capillaries i.e. efferent arterioles
    - Efferent arterioles offer resistance to blood flow
2. Branching of glomerular capillaries
    - Increased cross-sectional area results in only minor drop in pressure

#### Fall in mean BP from arteries to capillaries: typical renal vascular bed
- Estimated forces involved in glomerular filtration in humans
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/cwA7dLc.png =450x)

## Summary of estimated forces involved in glomerular filtration in humans
- Glomerular-capillary hydrostatic pressure (PCAP) reported between 45mmHg – 60mmHg 
- P~CAP~ decreases only slightly along length of glomerular capillaries because of large increase in cross-sectional area, and resistance to flow by presence of efferent arterioles
- π~CAP~ increases along length of glomerular capillaries as plasma protein concentration rises
- Net filtration occurs across glomerular capillaries: afferent end (18mmHg) and efferent end (5mmHg)
- Further reduction in P~CAP~ in efferent arterioles, whereas oncotic pressure (π~CAP~) is high (35mmHg): fluid reabsorbed in peritubular capillaries

## Key concepts
- Renal blood flow to kidneys is ~950 – 1100 ml/min (20% of cardiac output)
- This blood flow is far in excess of kidneys metabolic needs allowing kidneys flexibility to alter their blood flow in response to physiological demand
- Cortex receives an enormous volume of blood (glomerular and peritubular capillaries) whereas vasa recta are only blood supply to medulla
- Variable pressures along renal circulation influence filtration and reabsorption
    - Net filtration occurs across glomerular capillaries and net reabsorption occurs across peritubular capillaries
