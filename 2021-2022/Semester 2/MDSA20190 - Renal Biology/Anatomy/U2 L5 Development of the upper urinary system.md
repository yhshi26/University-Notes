## Learning objectives
- Understand early embryogenesis, formation of blastocyst, implantation (formation of epiblast and hypoblast), gastrulation (formation of ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm)
    - Know how mesoderm differentiates
- Explain development of kidneys and ureters
    - Explain development of the collecting system
    - Explain ascent of the kidneys
- Know of clinical considerations

## Early embryogenesis
- Cellular processes in embryogenesis:
    1. Gametogenesis: formation of gametes (egg/sperm)
    2. Fertilisation: joining of gametes to form zygote
    3. Cleavage: rapid mitosis forming morula (ball of cells) followed by blastocyst (ball of cells with cavity)
    4. Gastrulation: ball of cells rearranges into 3 germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm
    5. Embryonic folding: lateral and longitudinal folding of embryo
    6. Organogesis: formation of organs and systems

### Cleavage
- After fertilization, a zygote undergoes rapid mitosis (cleavage) to become a morula (ball of cells) followed by blastocyst (ball of cells with cavity):
    1. 4 cell stage: totipotency
    2. 8 cell stage: pluripotency
    3. Morula: compaction
    4. Blastocyst

#### Blastocyst formation (days 6-7)
- Morula (A) (ball of cells) hollows out to become blastocyst (B) (ball of cells with cavity)
- B structures:
    - Inner cell mass (embryoblast):
        - Source of embryonic stem cells
    - Blastocystic cavity (blastocoel):
        - Space of future yolk sac
    - Outer cell mass (trophoblast):
        - Extraembryonic tissues: embryonic membranes (chorion, amnion, allantois, yolk sac)

### Implantation: epiblast and hypoblast formation (days 7-9)
- Blastocyst implants in the endometrium along the anterior or posterior wall

### Gastrulation: germ layer (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm) formation
- Gastrulation: process that reorganizes bilaminar disc into trilaminar disc with 3 germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm
    - Begins with appearance of primitive streak on epiblast surface
    - Primitive streak elongates to cranial and caudal ends
        - Cranial end forms thickening (primitive node)
    - Epiblast cells invaginate to form endoderm and mesoderm, and epiblast becomes ectoderm (cells leave epiblast and delaminate, those that don't remain as endoderm
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/7nHRuB8.png =350x)
- Prenotochordal cells (derived from the mesoderm) invaginating in the primitive pit move forwards until they reach the prechordal plate, forming the notochordal plate, which becomes the notochord
- Notochord forms midline axis and forms basis of axial skeleton
- ![](https://www.med.umich.edu/lrc/coursepages/m1/embryology/embryo/images/gastrulation_1.gif =150x)
- During notochord and neural tube formation, the mesoderm splits into 3 regions:
    - Paraxial mesoderm: somites form segmental plate near midline
    - Intermediate cell mass (segmented): mesonephros
        - Intermediate mesoderm differentiates to form urogenital system
    - Lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) (unsegmented): splits into somatic (somatopleure) and splanchnic (splanchnopleure) layer
        - Lateral plate mesoderm differentiates after somites form around neural tube

## Urinary system development
- Urinary tract develops before the genital tract
- Gonads develop at the medial side of the kidney: urogenital tract
- Urogenital organs develop from intermediate mesoderm
- Formation of urogenital ridge forms the nephrogenic cord
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/iC87XNt.png =350x)

### Kidney development
- 3 sets of overlapping kidney systems develop in embryo
- From cranial to caudal:
    1. Pronephroi:
        - First set 
        - Rudimentary (transitional structures) and nonfunctional
        - Bilateral
        - Appear in week 4
        - Cell clusters and tubular structures
        - Devveloping neck region
        - Soon degenerate: most pronephric ducts persist
    3. Mesonephros:
        - Large, elongated excretory organs
            - Appear in late week 4
            - Interim kidneys (approx 4 weeks)
            - Consist of glomerula and mesonephric tubules (later become efferent ductules of testes)
                - Open into mesonephric ducts (originally pronephric ducts)
            - Ducts open into cloaca
        - Well developed, produces urine in week 6-10
            - About 40 glomerula with mesonephric tubules which open in the mesonephric ducts (originally pronephric ducts): open into the cloaca
            - Mesonephros degnerates month 3
            - Mesonephric tubules: efferent ductules of the testis
            - Mesonephric duct: Wolffian duct: epididymis, duct. deferens, ejaculatory duct, seminal gland
            - Paramesonephric duct: Muellerian duct: oviduct, uterus
    3. Metanephros:
        - The primordia of the permanent kidneys
        - Begin to develop in 5th week
        - Become functional approx. week 9
        - Urine formation continues throughout fetallife
        - Urine is excreted into the amniotic cavity and forms a component of the amniotic fluid
        - Kidneys develop from 2 sources:
            1. Ureteric bud: collecting system 
            2. Metanephrogenicblastema: nephrons 

#### Collecting system development
- Ureteric bud dilates and eventually forms (4):
    1. Ureter
    2. Renal pelvis
    3. Major and minor calyces
    4. Collecting ducts
- First 4 generations of tubules enlarge and merge: major calices
- Second 4 generations of tubules coalesce: minor calices
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/xlILNuV.png =350x)

#### Kidney ascent
- Initially kidneys are pelvic
- Kidneys "shift" cranially to the adult position by week 9 
    - Due to relative growth of embryo's body caudal to kidneys
- During shift (kidney ascent), blood supply changes
    - Initially kidneys are supplied by branches from common iliac artery, then later from aorta
- The more caudal vessels normally degenerate
    - If degeneration doesn't occur, supernumerary renal arteries may be present
- Note: while kidneys "shift" cranially, they rotate medially (almost 90 degrees)
- Note: nephron formation complete by week 36 (2 million nephrons)

### Kidney and ureter development
- Fetal kidneys: lobes, disappear at the end of the first postnatal year
- Note: large adrenal glands (become smaller during the first year of infancy)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/iznmZst.png =250x)

## Clinical considerations
### Renal agenesis
- Lack of kidney
    - Bilateral (death) or unilateral (mostly left)
- Cause: mutations in genes regulating DFNG (gonadal derived neurotrophic factor)
- Associated with:
    - Higher vulnerability to infection
    - Hypertension
    - Pulmonary hyperplasia
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/bKGfj7t.png =150x)

### Wilm's tumours (rare kidney cancer)
- Mutation in WT1 gene (crhomosome 11p13)
- Tumor developed by 5 years of age
- Prognosis reasonable: good
- Associated with:
    - WAGR syndrome: Wilms, aniridia, gonadoblastoma, mental retardation
    - Denys-Drash syndrome: renal failure, ambiguous genitalia, Wilms
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/F8VZNVX.png =200x)

### Multicystic dysplastic kidney
- Nephrons fail to develop, ureteric bud fails to branch, collecting ducts don't form
- Potter sequence:
    - Anuria (failure to produce urine)
    - Oligohydramnios
    - Hypoplastic lungs (incomplete)
- Congenital polycystic kidney:
    - Autosomal recessive: 1/5000 births, cysts in collecting ducts, renal failure in infancy/childhood
    - Autosomal dominant: 1/750, cysts any segment nephron, renal failure in adulthood
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ve9Bqal.png =200x)

### Duplicated ureter
- Early division of ureteric bud
- No clinical consequence
- Occasionally 2nd ureter is ectopic (entering vagina/urethra)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/2afN88i.png =200x)

### Horseshoe/pelvic kidney
- Kidneys normally ascend relative to original position
- Some vessels obstruct pathway
    - Umbilical artery fork: kidney remains stuck in pelvis
    - Kidneys pushed anteriorly and join
        - Horseshoe (1/600 people)
    - Associated with Turner and Edward syndrome
