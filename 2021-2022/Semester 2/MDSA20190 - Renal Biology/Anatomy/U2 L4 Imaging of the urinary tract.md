[Imaging urinary system](https://brightspace.ucd.ie/d2l/le/content/154724/viewContent/1845370/View)
###### tags: `MDSA20190 - Renal Biology`

## Structures of urinary system to image
- Kidneys: remove excess water, salts and wastes of protein metabolism from blood while returning nutrients and chemicals to blood
- Ureters: transport filtered fluid from kidney to bladder
- Urinary bladder: temporary storage site of urine
- Urethra: conducts urine form bladder to exterior

## Medical imaging technologies
- Radiography: first line assessment for kidneys and bladder
    - Intravenous Urography (IVU): used historically to assess for renal stones
- Ultrasonography: characterization of renal masses, renal stones, bladder stones, masses in bladder, assess the involvement of surrounding structures such as collecting systems and surrounding vessels
- Endoscopy: cytoscopy: inner surface of bladder
- Computer Tomography (CT): characterization of renal masses or assess trauma (next line of investigation after an abdominal X-ray in an accident or emergency department)
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): mainly used to characterise renal masses when CT is inconclusive

### Radiography
- Used for first line assessment for kidneys and bladder
- Intravenous Urography (IVU), Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP), retrograde pyelogram: used hytorically to asssess for renal stones
- Contrast agent is given intravenously (or into bladder), allowed to be cleared by kidneys and excreted through urinary tract as part of urine
- Mostly replaced by CT (more specific information on etiology)
- Arteriography: contrast medium injected in femoral artery for visualization of renal arteries
    - Indications: suspected aneurysm, renal artery stenosis, renovascular hypertension and trauma, palpable renal masses, chronic pyelonephritis, renal abscesses, and determination of the suitability of a (donor) kidney for renal transplantation

#### Intravenous Urography (IVU)
- Iodinated contrast administered to patient
- Shows morphology of the renal collecting system
- Uretopelvic junction: L2
- Ureterovesical junction: ischial spines

##### Intravenous Urography (IVU): kidneys
- Healthy pelvis vs. grossly dilated pelvis:

### Ultrasonography
- Used for characterization of renal masses, renal stones, bladder stones, masses in the bladder, assess the involvement of surrounding structures such as collecting systems and surrounding vessels
- Uses sound waves with frequencies which are higher than those audible to humans (>20,000 Hz)
- Probe/transducer sends pulses of ultrasound into tissue
- The ultrasound pulses echo off tissues with different reflection properties and are recorded and displayed as an image
- Fluid: black: hypoechoic; Connective tissue, bone: white: hyperechoic
- B-Mode (Brightness): acoustic impedance of a two-dimensional cross-section of tissue
- Doppler Mode: blood flow
- M-Mode: time motion display of the ultrasound wave along a chosen ultrasound line: monodimensional view of the heart
- Also: 3D images, 4D images
- Advantages: portable, low cost, no ionizing radiation
- Disadvantages: artefacts, areas difficult to images (behind bone, air), skilled operator

### Endoscopy
- Used for examination of bladder (cytoscopy)
- Visualization of the inner surface using an endoscope (rigid or flexible)
- Indications: 
    - Urinary tract infections;
    - Blood in the urine (hematuria);
    - Painful urination, chronic pelvic pain, or interstitial cystitis;
    - Urinary blockage such as from prostateenlargement, stricture, or narrowing of the urinary tract;
    - Stone in the urinary tract; and
    - Polyp, tumor, or cancer

### Computer Tomography (CT)
- Used for characterization of renal masses or assess trauma (next line of investigation after an abdominal X-ray in an Accident and Emergency department)
- Computer-processed combinations of X-rays taken from different angles: cross-sectional (tomographic) images (virtual "slices") of specific areas of a scanned object
    - Three-dimensional volume of the inside of the object from a small series of two-dimensional radiographic images taken around a single axis of rotation
    - Huge volume of data: can be reformatted in various planes or even as volumetric (3D) representations of structures

### Magnetic Resonance Tomography/Imaging (MRT/MRI)
- Used for soft tissue (brain, heart, breast, muscles)
- Urinary tract: mainly used to characterise renal masses when CT is inconclusive
- MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, magnetic field gradients, and radio waves to generate images 
    - Constant magnetic field and radio frequencies bounce off of the fat and water molecules in the body; radio waves are transmitted to a receiver in the machine which is translated into an image
    - MRI does not involve X-rays or the use of ionizing radiation
- MRI risks:
    - Possible reactions to metals due to magnets (implants, pacemaker, IUD, artificial joints)
    - Loud noises from the machine (causing hearing issues)
    - Increase in body temperature during long MRIs
    - Claustrophobia

### Computer Tomography (CT) vs. Magnetic Resonance Tomography/Imaging (MRT/MRI)
- CT scan: fast (15 mins), can provide pictures of tissues, organs, and skeleton
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/Xf8woIi.png =200x)
- MRI: diagnosis of abnormal masses, more detailed information especially in soft tissue
