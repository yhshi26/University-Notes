    - Location
    - Relations
    - Structure
    - Supply
    - Clinical considerations

## Overview: urinary bladder (UB)
- Urinary bladder (vesicle)
    - Muscular, hollow sac that collects and stores urine until it is ready to be excreted (micturation) via the urethra
        - Maximum volume of urine stored: 500 mL
        - Note: urine excretion (micturation) occurs involuntarily in infants and young children until age of 2-5 years

### Location
- Pelvic organ, varies in size, shape, position (and relations) according to:
    - Its content 
        - Full urinary bladder around abdominal cavity
        - Empty urinary bladder in pelvic cavity
    - State of neighbouring viscera
        - Full rectum or pregnant uterus can impact position
    - Sex and age of individual
        - By/after puberty, in adult position (empty urinary bladder in pelvic cavity)
            - Empty adult bladder located in lesser pelvis, superoposterior to pubic bones
                - Separated by retropubic space (cave of Retzius), which is extraperitoneal 
                - Lies mostly under cover of peritoneum (sub/infra-peritoneal)
                - Rests anteriorly on pubic bones and posteriorly on pelvic floor muscles (levator ani and coccygeus)
        - Pre/before puberty, in higher position (empty urinary bladder in abdominal cavity)
- Urinary bladder lies above urogenital (UG) diaphragm
    - Triangular musculofascial diaphragm in anterior perineum/urogenital triangle of pelvic outlet (gap of pubic arch)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/3eb3oJY.png =250x)
    - Formed by external urethral sphincter muscle + deep transverse perineal muscle and covered by perineal membrane
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/yCKDEVC.png =250x)
    - Lies externally and inferiorly to pelvic diaphragm/floor

### Relations in F and M
- Slightly different positions, in non-distended (empty) bladders:
    - Females: directly related to superoanterior wall of vagina and separated from uterus by vesicouterine pouch and from rectum by rectouterine pouch (of Douglas)
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/D85WpXQ.png =250x)
    - Males: separated from rectum by rectovesical pouch centrally and related to seminal glands and ampullae of ductus deferens posterolaterally and prostate inferiorly
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/mpOxXys.png =250x)

### Empty urinary bladder: external structure
- Tetrahedrom shape: 4 sides, 4 angles, 4 ducts
    - 4 surfaces (rowboat shape): 1 superior, 2 inferolateral, 1 inferoposterior
    - 4 ducts: 2 ureters, 1 urachus (median umbilical fold), 1 urethra
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/9TPsuNM.png =200x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/ePZ8fU9.png =200x)

### Urinary bladder: external structure
- Apex (anterior): points toward superior edge of pubic symphysis
- Fundus/base: convex inferoposterior wall (opposite apex)
- Body: major portion b/t apex and fundus
- Neck: where fundus/base and inferolateral surfaces meet
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/YJWS8Uc.png =250x)

### Urinary bladder wall layers: superficial to deep coats
- Muscular (muscularis): 3 layers of interlacing smooth muscle
    - Detrusor muscle: 1 circular b/t 2 longitudinal layers
    - Circular layer forms internal urethral sphincter at neck
- Submucosa (lamina): contains vessels, nerves, glands
    - Tumour spread here can metastasise through body via lymph and blood vessels
- Mucosa (folds of mucous membrane: rugae)
    - Contains transitional epithelium (urothelium): inner lining present in urinary tract (beginnignw / minor calyces in kidneys) in contact w/ urine
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/CTfzqtX.png =550x)

### Urinary bladder trigone: where interal orifices and meatus meet
- Ureters attach posterolaterally via right and left ureterovesicle orifice (orifice: mouth-like opening) and they open through internal urethral meatus (meatus: slit-like opening)
- Urethra drains urine via neck of bladder (where base and inferolateral surfaces meet)
- Connect orifices and meatus = pyramid shape = bladder trigone
    - Interior of bladder wall
    - Within fundus/base (inferoposterior wall)
    - Smooth mucous membrane, more vascularised, relativel non-distensible (doesn't stretch like rest of urinary bladder)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/KcWhqjZ.png =250x)

### Urinary bladder neck: where base and inferolateral surface meet
- Muscle fibers in bladder neck are continuous with muscle fibers in wall of urethra and:
    - In females: continuous with pelvic fascia
    - In males: continuous with fibromuscular tissue of prostate

### What keeps urinary bladder in place?
- Urinary bladder is relatively free w/in extraperitoneal fatty tissue, except for firmly fixed neck:
    - 3-4 cm below pubic symphysis
    - Internal urethral orifice continuous with proximal urethra
    - Continuous with: in females pelvic fascia, in males prostate
    - Passes through urogenital diaphragm
    - Pubovesical ligaments: in females ligaments always named pubovesical (no prostate in way) and have 2 pairs, in males 2 pubovesical (puboprostatic) ligaments (prostate is in way of ligaments, hence names used interchangeably)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/qcqdTVi.png =250x)
- Urinary bladder supported by:
    - Condensations of pelvic fascia
        - Attach bladder to pubic, lateral pelvic side-walls, rectum/uterus
    - Pubovesical ligaments (anterior) and levator ani (inferoposterior)
    - Median (urachus remnant) and lateral (peritoneal reflections) umbilical ligaments
        - Hold apex and body (respectively)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/I1JdGeQ.png =350x)

### Urinary bladder supply
- Rich supply w/ excellent collateral circulation
    - Superior, middle, inferior vesical arteries
        - From anterior division of interal iliac (hypogastric) artery
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/vVw8UPU.png =335x)
- Rich venous plexus drains into internal iliac vein
    - In males: + prostatic venous plexus 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/DCAlEK3.png =300x)
- Lymph drainage: external (yellow) and interal (green) iliac nodes
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/ei00Rhh.png =400x)

## Overview: urethra
- Muscular duct for passage of urine out of neck of bladder (at the internal urethral sphincter) to external opening (at the external urethral meatus in vulval vestibule in females, and tip of glans penis in males)
- Length differs in males and females:
    - Males: 18-20 cm
    - Females: 4 cm
- Females appear to pee more frequently than males, but human males do not have stronger urethral sphincter muscles than females; due to difference in relative body size and internal repro anatomy
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/qfIt7Ja.png =450x)

### Urethral sphincters (US)
- Urethral sphincter muscles envelop urethra to control flow of urine
    - When contracted, the internal and external urethral sphincters close urethra
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/Tcy1mIK.png =250x)
- Internal urethral sphincter (IUS):
    - Continuous with detrusor muscle (autonomic; smooth muscle) of:
        - Bladder neck + proximal urethra in females/bladder enck + prostate in males
            - In males: internal urethral sphincter is primary muscle for prohibiting release of urine
        - Ureteric orifices encircled by detruser tighten when bladder contracts to prevent urine reflux into ureters
- External urethral sphincter (EUS):
    - Composed of striated muscle (somatic; skeletal muscle)
    - In females: located distally and inferiorly to blader neck, b/t vaginal orifice and clitoris
        - In females: external urethral sphincter is primary muscle for prohibiting release of urine
    - In males: continuous with isthmus of prostate at level of membranous urethra
    
## Innervation of urinary bladder and urethral sphincters
- Autonomic nervous system (via paired inferior hypogastric plexus)
    - Sympathetic nervous system: from T11 to L2 (of internal iliac/hypogastric nerve)
    - Parasympathetic nervous system: from S2 to S4 (the pelvic splanchnic nerve)
        - Parasympathetics to detrusor of:
            - Urinary bladder to contract (expel urine)
            - Internal urethral sphincter to relx (release urine)
- Note: for urine to exit bladder, both autonomic controlled internal urethral sphincter + somatic (voluntary) controlled external urethral sphincter (S2-4, pudendal nerve) must relax
    - Diseases or injuries of nervous system in adults can cause involuntary or relfux micturation, leading to urinary incontinence

### Innervation involvement in micturation
- Storage and elimination of urine depend on coordinated activity of smooth and striated muscle in 2 functional units:
    1. Reservoir (bladder)
    2. Outlets (bladder neck, urethral sphincters)
- Thus:
    - Bladder fills, stretch receptors in detrusor muscle sense filling
    - Voiding urine begins with voluntary relaxation of external urethral sphincter
    - Internal urethral sphincter relaxes spontaneously
    - Parasympathetic impulses induce contractions of bladder
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/TtNYorN.png =300x)

### More on innervation of urethra and urinary bladder
- External urethral sphincter is under voluntary control 
    - Via S2-4 nerve roots (deep perineal branch of pudendal nerve)
    - Voluntary control until bladder distention becomes acute
- Muscular bladder walls and internal urethral sphincter are controlled by autonomic nervous system via hypogastric plexus
    - Sympathetic nervous system: T11-L2: detrusor muscle of bladder is relaxed (allows bladder to fill) and internal urethral sphincter contracts
    - Parasympathetic nervous system: sacral; opposite: contracts detrusor muscle of bladder (squeezes out urine) and relaxes/inhibits (opens) internal urethral sphincter

## Internal and external urethral sphincters in males and females
### Male internal urethral sphincter: 2 functions
1. Prohibits release of urine
2. Contracts involuntarily during ejaculation to prevent retrograde ejaculation (ejaculatory reflux) of semen into bladder ("dry orgasm")
    - Semen enters urinary bladder instead of emerging through penis during orgasm
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/zktIQq8.png =250x)
- Note: ejaculatory ducts carry semen:
    - Spermatozoa from vas deferens
    - Seminal fluid from seminal vesicles (small gladns: 1 right, 1 left)
        - Semen enters urethra via:
            - Ejaculatory duct formed by union of vas deferns with duct of seminal vesicle
            - Ejaculatory ducts (1 right, 1left) pass through prostate and open into urethra at seminal colliculus
            - Sperm and seminal fluid mix in ejaculatory duct
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/cnyAash.png =350x)

### Female external urethral sphincter
- External urethral sphincter (urogenital sphincter) has most prominent effect for prohibiting release of urine in females
- 3 parts:
    1. Sphincter urethrae muscle: wraps around urethra and is circular (as in males)
    2. Compressor urethrae muscle: wraps anteriorly around urethra and connects to ischial rami; contraction squeezes urethra against vagina
    3. Urethrovaginal muscle (urethrovaginal sphincter) wraps around vagina and urethra; contraction constricts both

## Clinical considerations
### Female urethra
- Recall: internal urethral sphincter continuous with bladder neck, passes through urogenital diaphragm to form external urethral sphincter
    - Urethra may be damaged by vaginal birth and coitus
- Clinical implications of the size of the female urethra:
    - Shorter and slightly wider, thus more susceptible to urinary tract infections (UTI)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/wx7e2hZ.png =350x)

### Male urethra: 3 parts, 2 functions
1. Prostatic
    - Continuation from bladder neck, travels through prostate where gland receives ejacuatory ducts (sperm from testes and seminal fluid from vesicle glands) and prostatic ducts (contains alkaline fluid)
        - Widest and most dilatable portion of urethra
    - Can be involved in ejaculatory reflux or can be occluded in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (increased number of cells) or carcinoma
2. Membranous (intermediate)
    - Passes through pelvic floor and travels through diaphragm to form voluntary external urethral sphincter
        - Narrowest and least dilatable portion of urethra
    - Can be involved in extravasation of urine (urine escapes its normal pathway)
3. Spongy (penile)
    - Extends from ureogenital diaphragm and passes through bulb and corpus spongiosum of penis, ending at external urethral orifice/meatus
    - Can be involved in extravasation of urine (urine escapes its normal pathway)
- ![](https://images.medindia.net/amp-images/patientinfo/male-urethra.jpg =250x)

#### Male extravasation of urine
- Extravasation: escape of fluid (urine, blood) to surrounding tissues due to damage
    - Urethra most common site
    - Usually in males
    - Leads to collection of urine in other cavities: perineal spaces, scrotum, penis, abdominal wall, thigh
- Extravasation is caused by damage such as:
    - Trauma
    - Periurethral abscess
    - Incorrectly placed medical device
        - E.g. bougienage (thin cylinder to expand passageway)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/CXCQzgG.png =335x)
- Extravasation leads to affects:
    - Urine + infection cause severe oedema of scrotum and abdominal wall
    - If not treated, skin over scrotum, penis, anterior abdominal wall may slough off
    - If renal function impared, may be deadly
- Extravasation can be treated by:
    - IV fluid replacement
    - Catheterisation (to drain bladder)
    - Divert urine flow (e.g. suprapubic cytostomy: anaesthetic + incision)
    - Antibiotics
