#### Abdominal cavity
- Below thoracic diaphragm and above true/lesser pelvis
- Abdominal walls consist of:
    - Skin, fat
    - Anterior and posterior abdominal wall muscles
    - Transversalis (transverse) fascia
        - Aponeurotic (flat, thin, sheet-like) membrane b/t inner surface of transversus abdominis muscle and parietal peritoneum
        - Forms a part of genearl layer of fascia lining abdominal walls, continuous with iliac and pelvic fasciae
    - Parietal peritoneum
- Anterolateral abdomianl wall muscles, superficial to deep:
    - External oblique
    - Internal oblique
    - Rectus abdominis
    - Transversus abdominis
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/VCW6KX2.png =450x)

#### Peritoneum
- Sections through abdominopelvic cavities representing peritoneum: thin serous membrane that lines cavities (parietal) and invests most intra-abdominal and pelvic organs (visceral)
    - Is not the same as fascia
- Types include (5):
    1. Greater omentum (from stomach)
    2. Visceral peritoneum (around intestine)
    3. Parietal peritoneum
    4. Lesser omentum (from liver)
    5. a) lesser sac (GO+LO) and b) greater sac (in peritoneum but outside LS)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/BAavBzn.png =200x)
- Potential spaces include (4):
    1. Intraperitoneal: w/in abdominal cavity but wrapped in (nearly completely covered by) visceral peritoneum
        - Not actually inside of, but project into peritoneal cavity
        - Intrapertioneal structures are mobile (e.g. uterus)
    2. Retroperitoneal: w/in abdominal cavity but behind peritoneum (only have peritoneum on anterior side)
        - Retroperitoneal structures are not suspended (are fixed)
            - Kidneys fixed to post abdominal wall, cannot move freely
            - Prostate fixed b/t peritoneum and plevic cavity wall
    3. Extraperitoneal: portion of abdomen and pelvis which does not lie w/in peritoneum, includes (2):
        1. Retroperitoneal space (posterior to peritoneum)
        2. Retropubic space (anterior to peritoneum and deep to pubic bone)
    4. Sub(infra)peritoneal: below peritoneum (e.g. urinary bladder) 

##### Retroperitoneal space
- Retroperitoneal space = b/t T12 and false pelvis
- ![](http://radiologykey.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/f16-02-9780323353755.jpg =250x)
- Lined by fascia and fat
- Floor made of posterior abdominal wall muscles (4):
    1. Psoas major/minor
    2. Quadratus lumborum
    3. Transversus abdominis
    4. Thoracic diaphragm
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/8dVi5cC.png =450x)
- Contents include SAD PUCKER:
    - Suprarenal glands
    - Aorta/IVC
    - Duodenum (except prox 2cm)
    - Pancreas (except tail)
    - Ureters (proximal 1/2)
    - Colon (ascending: R, descending: L)
    - Kidneys
    - Esophagus
    - Rectum/anal canal

### Kidneys surrounded by (from outside in)
- Pararenal fat: adipose tissue acts to cushion kidney (not very close)
- Renal fascia: thin layer of fibrous connective tissue (continuation of extraperitoneal fascia)
    - Also encloses suprarenal glands
- Perirenal fat: adipose tissue acts to cusion kidney (is very close)
- Renal capsule: dense connective tissue
    - With infection and oedema: extremely painful as capsule does not allow for swelling
- ![](https://teachmeanatomy.info/wp-content/uploads/External-Coverings-of-the-Kidney.jpg =350x)

### Location and size
- Location: either side of vertebral column, usually b/t vertebral level T12 to L3
    - Note: hilum at level L1
    - Levels alter slightly with respiration and posture
    - Right kidney slightly lower than left due to liver on right side
    - Superior pole oriented more medially and posteriorly than inferior pole
    - ![](https://healthjade.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kidney-location-1.jpg =350x)
- Average size 11 x 7 x 3 cm
    - M: 125-170 g
    - F: 115-155 g

#### Siding kidneys
- To determine which (right/left) kidney you are looking at (if it is isolated from the body), look at (3):
    1. To determine poles: (what's up/down?)
        - Superior pole flattened and covered by suprarenal gland
        - Inferior pole pointed
    2. To determine borders: (what's medial/lateral?)
        - Lateral border convex
        - Medial border concave
    3. To determine surfaces: (what's front/back?)
        - Anterior surface convex
        - Posterior surface flat
            - Think: relations of posterior surface?
    4. Connections via renal hilum: VAP
        - V (vein: ventral)
        - A (artery: b/t)
        - P (pelvis: posterior)

#### Anterior relations differ on R and L
- Both: suprarenal glands
- Left: 
    - Gastric fundus (of stomach)
    - Hilum of spleen
    - Tail of pancreas
    - Jejunum of small intestine
    - Left colic flexure of descending colon
- Right:
    - Right hepatic (of liver) lobe
    - Duodenum of small intestine
    - Right colic flexure of ascending colon
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/1z5AlgF.png =350x)

#### Posterior relations
- No peritoneum
- Fat
- Fascia
- L1 transverse process
- Abdominal wall muscles (4):
    1. Thoracic diaphragm
    2. Quadratus lumborum
    3. Psoas major and minor
    4. Transversus abdominus
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/X5LW1u5.png =350x)

### Major function of kidney: filter blood
- Supplied by:
    - Large renal arteries, from aorta
        - Aorta is in left side of body, thus right renal artery generally longer than left
            - Right renal artery is posterior to inferior vena cava
- Drained by:
    - Large renal veins, to inferior vena cava
        - Inferior vena cava is in right side of body, thus left renal vein generally longer than right
            - Left renal vein passes anterior to aorta
- ![](https://teachmeanatomy.info/wp-content/uploads/Arterial-and-Venous-Supply-to-the-Kidneys.jpg =350x)

#### Blood transport to/from the glomerulus/kidney
- Supply:
    - Aorta gives off right and left renal arteries
    - Renal arteries divide into 5 segmental arteries which enter hilum and branch into:
        - Local artery: 1 per pyramid which divide into
        - Interlobular arteries: 2 per lobe (ascend in renal columns) which divide into
        - Arcuate artery (in junction b/t cortex and medulla): arches over base of pyramid, send
        - Interlobular artery into cortex: supply afferent arterioles to glomerulus (filtering mechanisms of nephrons)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/BvJUYqs.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/Wr78JNN.png =225x)
- Drainage: 
    - Venous drainage: reverse path of arteries to inferior vena cava
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/KJGbxoZ.png =550x)
    - Lymphatic drainage: lumbar (aortic) lymph nodes
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/yrtHnv6.png =250x)

### Nerve supply
- Renal nerves: parasympathetic nervous system/sympathetic nervous system
    - Mostly postganglionic sympahtetic nervous system fibers
- Renal plexus: branches from celiac ganglion and plexus, aortic plexus, and splachnic nerves
    - Note: communicate w/ spermatic plexus; may explain pain in testis in affections of kidney
    - Nerves accompany renal artery and its branches
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/UKz4kPM.png =250x)

## Ureters
- Extraperitoneal distensible (stretchable) muscular tubes connecting kidneys w/ bladder (transport urine)
    - 25-30 cm length
    - Upper 1/2 abdominal, lower 1/2 pelvic
    - Pass posteriorly to bladder and enter at an oblique angle to prevent reflux
    - ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Duplicated_ureter.svg/1200px-Duplicated_ureter.svg.png =150x)
- 3 potential sites of constriction/obstruction for kidney stones to lodge:
    1. Narrowing of ureteric pelvis (transitional renal pelvis)
    2. Ureter crosses brim of pelvic inlet
    3. Course through wall of bladder
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/epah3Cv.png =225x)

### Course of ureters
- From renal pelvis at hilum
- Descends vertically (behind perietal peritoneum)
- Lies on psoas muscle
- Runs to level of transverse processes
- Crosses bifurcation of common iliacs
- Runs to level of ischial spine
- Enters bladder posteromedially at angle through slit-like opening
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/kUedUuM.png =350x)

### Supply of ureters
- Supplied by: nearby arteries
    - Renal, gonadal, superior vesicle arteries
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/g0UnMts.png =250x)
- Drained by: veins with similar pattern
- Nerve supply: from adjacent nervous plexuses
    - Renal, testicular, hypogastric
        - Allows for peristalsis
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/wlOSPK8.png =225x)
- Lymph drainage: same as kidney
    - Lumbar (aortic) lymph nodes
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/yrtHnv6.png =250x)
