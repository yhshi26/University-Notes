## Quiz from last lecture
1. How long does embryo stay in oviduct? When does it implant?
    - Embryo stays in oviduct 4-5 days
    - Blastocyst adheres to uterine wall (implantation occurs) day 9 (but can be between day 6-12)
2. Name different parts of blastocyst and what develops out of them.
    - ICM (inner cell mass): precursor for organs and tissues (ICM = stem cells)
    - Trophoplast: precursor for fetal membranes
    - Blastocoel: space filled with water and nutrients, precursor for yolk sac
3. What develops from endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm?
    - Endoderm: innermost layer, precursor for most of epithelia of inner organs
    - Mesoderm: intermediate layer, precursor for most of connective tissue
    - Ectoderm: outermost layer, precursor for epithelium of most outer organs (e.g. skin)
4. Name all structures in developing mesoderm (image provided).
    - Neural tube
    - Notochord
    - Mesoderm (composed of 3 parts):
        1. Paraxial mesoderm
            - Precursor for bone and vertebrae
        2. Intermediate mesoderm
            - Precursor for urogenital tract
        3. Lateral mesoderm (composed of 2 walls):
            1. Inner wall (splanchnopleura)
                - Precursor for connective tissue of inner organs
            2. Outer wall (somatopleura)
                - Precursor for connective tissue of outer organs
5. Name sequence of development of different organ systems. Which is first?
    1. Neural system
    2. Cardiovascular system
    3. Gastrointestinal system
    4. Urogenital system
    5. Respiratory system
6. Name all structures in embryo wk 5 (image provided).
7. What is the difference between embryo and fetus?
    - Embryo: organ systems are developing (week 1-8)
    - Fetus: organ systems are developed, fetus only undergoes growth and differentiating (week 8+)

## Development of bladder
- During weeks 4-7 cloaca is divided by urorectal septum into:
    - Urogenital sinus (precursor for bladder and urethra), anteriorly
    - Anal canal (precursor for rectum), posteriorly

### Ureters and mesonephric ducts during development
- Cave: trigone (triangular area between base of ureters) is derived from caudal ends of mesonephric ducts

#### Trigone visible in fully developed bladder
- Site where tumours can occur
- ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Illu_bladder.jpg =450x)

### Urogenital sinus
1. Vesical part: forms most of bladder, continuous with allantois
2. Pelvic part: entire urethra in females, prostatic part of urethra in males
3. Phallic part: clitoris in females, primordium of penis in males
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/0jab5pJ.png =250x)

### Development of bladder
- Allantois contricts to become a thick fibrous cord (now called urachus)
    - In adults urachus becomes median umbilical ligament
    - Clinical consideration: abnormal persistence of allantois after birth results in urine draining from umbilicus after birth
- Endoderm of urogenital sinus gives rise to epithelium of bladder
    - Other layers develop from mesenchyme (derived from mesoderm)
- After absorption of mesonephric ducts, ureters open separately into bladder

## Amniotic fluid circulation
- Amniotic fluid is produced by cells (amnioblasts) lining amniotic cavity
- Embryo and fetus swallow amniotic fluid and a corresponding amount of fluid is excreted via kidneys
    - Fluid excreted is not urine
    - True waste products are handled by mother via placenta
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/xnNaLR0.png =250x)

### Amniotic fluid volume
- 30 ml at 10 weeks
- 450 ml at 20 weeks
- 800-1000 ml at 37 weeks
- By 5th month, fetus swallows amniotic fluid at rate: 400 ml daily
    - Fetal urine present is mostly water
    - Placenta exchanges metabolic waste

### Amniotic fluid purpose
- Absorbs jolts
- Permits fetal lung development
- Acts as barrier to infection
- Prevents adherence of embryo to amnion
- Helps control body temperature
- Allows fetal movement and uniform growth
- Maintains homeostasis of fluid and electrolytes

## Clinical considerations
### Abnormal amniotic fluid circulation
#### Oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid)
- Diagnosed in 4% pregnant women
- Commonly diagnosed in 3rd trimester
- Typically caused by:
    - Placental issues, not providing enough nutrients, baby stops recycling fluid
    - Birth defects involving kidneys
    - Leaking of amniotic fluid
    - Post date pregnancy
    - Maternal diabetes, hypertension, preeclampsia
- Leads to fetal abnormalities: pulmonary hypoplasia, facial defects, limb defects
- Treatment: 
    - Oral, IV hydration
    - Saline amniofusion during labour
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/y7Bsjzw.png =150x)

#### Polyhydramnios (high amniotic fluid)
- Diagnosed in 1% pregnant women
- Chronic polyhydramnios: gradual accumulation
- Acute polyhydramnios: rapid collection
- Maternal discomfort breathing
- Typically caused by:
    - Idiopathic (35%)
    - Maternal/gestational diabetes (25%)
    - Congenital malformaitons, anencephaly and gastrointestinal defects that prevent swallowing
- Associated with severe anomalies of fetal CNS (anencephaly)
- Treatment:
    - Therapeutic amniocentesis (draining)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/UQ2uTQ6.png =150x)

### Urachal abnormalities
- Urachal fistula: allantois lumen persists, urine drains into umbilicus
- Urachal cyst: allantois lumen persists in local region
- Urachal sinus: allantois lumen persists in upper region
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/vAYqP7B.png =350x)

### Bladder defects
- Exstrophy of cloaca:
    - Severe ventral body wall defect
    - Can also involve intestines as well as bladder exposed
    - 1/30000 live births
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/KuRYvT4.png =150x)
- Extrophy of bladder:
    - Ventral body wall defect
    - Bladder mucosa exposed
    - 1/50000 live births
    - Predominantly males
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/bKsRl5V.png =150x)

### Others
- Ectopic ureter:
    - Ureter does not enter urinary bladder
    - Males: opens into urethra, ductus deferens, prostate, seminal gland
    - Females: opens inot urethra, vagina
    - Incontinence, urine leaking from urethra/vagina

- Hypospadias:
    - Birth defect (congenital condition)
    - Urethra opens on underside of penis (instead of tip)
    - Surgical correction (6-12 months of age)
