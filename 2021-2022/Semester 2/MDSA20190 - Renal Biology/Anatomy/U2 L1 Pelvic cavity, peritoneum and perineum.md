## Overview
- Pelvis: bony framework for inferior urinary structures
    - With muscular pelvic walls and floor
- Pelvic cavity: contains urinary, reproductive and excretory organs
- Perinuem: shallow compartment below pelvic floor
- Peritoneum: lining of adbominopelvic cavity and viscera
- Pelvic vessels and nerves

### Pelvis
- Region inferior to abdomen
- Pelvic cavity surrounded by pelvic girdle which is essential for transfer of trunk load to lower limb
    - Pelvic girdle: 2 ossa coxae (subdivided into ilium, ishium, pubis connected via pubic symphysis) attach to sacrum via sacroiliac joints

- Pelvic cavity surrounded by borders 
    - Pelvic inlet/brim border:
        - Pubis: pectineal line, pubic crest
        - Ilium: arcuate line
        - Sacrum: promontory, alae
        - ![](https://teachmeanatomy.info/wp-content/uploads/Borders-of-the-Pelvic-Inlet-The-Pelvic-Brim.jpg =350x)
    - Pelvic outlet border: 
        - Pubis: pubic arch/subpubic angle
        - Ilium: ischial tuberosities, inferior margin of sacrotuberous ligament (b/t coccyx and ischial tuberosity)
        - Sacrum and coccyx: lateral margins
        - ![](https://teachmeanatomy.info/wp-content/uploads/Borders-of-the-Pelvic-Outlet.jpg =300x)

#### Greater and lesser pelvis
- Greater (flase/major) pelvis:
    - Above pelvic inlet/brim
    - Between iliac wings/blades
    - Contains inferior abdominal organs
- Lesser (true/minor) pelvis:
    - Between pelvic inlet and pelvic outlet
    - Skeletal framework for pelvic cavity
    - Bounded inferiorly by pelvic floor/diaphragm
- ![](https://o.quizlet.com/aXtbe0YHiFBupL.gYahemg.jpg =550x)

#### Pelvic wall muscles
- Contribute structurally to pelvic walls and assist in closing posterior pelvic outlet
    - Piriformis muscle
    - Obturator internus muscle
        - Obturator internus muscle and its thickened fascia (tendinous arch of levator ani) provide an attachment site for levator ani muscle of pelvic floor
    - ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Posterior_Hip_Muscles_1.PNG =200x)
- Tendons of piriformis muscle and obturator internus muscle  exit pelvis via greater and elssor sciatic foramen, respectively, to anchor to greater trochanter of femur
    - Both muscles laterally rotate femur

#### Pelvic floor/diaphragm muscles
- Musculofascial diaphragm of 2 muscle complexes (levator ani and coccygeus)
    - Separates pelvic cavity (above pelvic floor) from perineal region (below pelvic floor)
    - Stretches b/t walls of lesser pelvis (musculofascial hammock) w/ midline gaps for urethra, vagina, anal canal
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/i9CwRfr.png =350x)

##### Pelvic floor/diaphragm functions
- Visceral support
    - Urinary bladder
    - Rectum
    - Uterus
- SPhincteric action
    - Urinary bladder
    - Rectum
- Support for gravid (pregnant) uterus and parturition (birth)

##### Weak pelvic floor/diaphragm and overactive bladder
- Weak pelvic floor muscles are not normal at any age, can be reversed through exercise
- Types of urinary incontinence (UI):
    - Stress incontinence: urine leaks occasionally when coughing, sneezing, lifting, ecercising
    - Urge incontinence: unable to hold urine when there is an urge to urinate
        - High risk during/after pregnancy and following childbirth
    - UI risk also following menopause, prostate enlarge and/or surgery, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, back injury, cerebral vascular accident, dementia
- Overactive bladder treatments:
    - Medication, botox, sacral neuromodulator/sacral nerve stimulator
        - B/c due to mechanical disruption of muscular support structures (not neurological as w/ fecal incontinence)

### Perineum
- Perineum: shallow compartment lying inferior to pelvic floor and spanning from pubis to coccyx
    - Contains urinary, reproductive and excretory organs, and neurovascular supply
    - Includes anus and external genitalia
    - Perinal body/central tendon of perineum (below) provides support to the pelvic floor
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/9HTQ8d0.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/22TpZ8o.png =250x)

#### Perineum divisions
- Imaginary line through 2 ischial tuberosities, divides perineum into 2 triangles:
    - Urogenital (UG) triangle (anteriorly)
        - Bounded by pubic symphysis, ischiopubic rami and theoretical line b/n ischial tuberosities
        - Associated w/ uretrha and external genitalia
        - Structurally complex, w/ numerous fascial layers and deep and superficial perineal fascial spaces (pouches)
        - UG diaphragm: in UG triangle, triangular-shaped muscular membrane created by external urethral sphincter (sphincter urethrae muscle) and deep transverse perineal muscle
            - Below urinary bladder and internal urethral sphincter, has openings for urethra and vagina
            - Has superior and inferior (perinal membrane) layer of fascia w/ pouches on its superior and inferior surfaces
    - Anal triangle (posteriorly)
    - ![](https://teachmeanatomy.info/wp-content/uploads/Borders-of-the-Perineum.jpg =450x)
- Perinal body: pyramidal fibromsucular mass in midline at junction of urogenital and anal triangles
    - Females: b/t vagina and anus
    - Males: b/t bulb of penis and anus
    - Point of attachment fo rfibers from pelvic floor and perineal muscle

##### Perineal body
- Essential for integrity of pelvic floor, esp. in females
    - Rupture during vaginal delivery leads to widening of gap b/t anterior free borders of both sides of levator ani muscles that bound the urogenital haitus
    - Predisposes to prolapse of uterus, urinary bladder, rectum

### Peritoneum
- Thin serous membrane lining of abdominopelvic cavity: supports (most) organs, conduit for their blood/lymph/nerve supply
    - Pelvic peritoneum is continuous w/ abdominal peritoneum in lesser pelvis starting at the pubic symphysis
    - 2 continuous layers:
        - Parietal peritoneum: lines internal walls of cavities
        - Visceral peritoneum: invest organs in cavities
- Visceral peritoneum arranged around organs such that pelvic peritoneal spaces (pouches/recesses) occur
- ![](https://teachmeanatomy.info/wp-content/uploads/Structure-of-the-Peritoneum-and-Peritoneal-Cavity.jpg =250x)

#### Female pelvic peritoneum: pelvic spaces
- Starts from superior border of pubic symphysis
- Continues over urinary bladder, dips down into vesicouterine recess and is reflected back up onto fundus and portion of body of uterus
- Continues down surface of uterus to post fornix of vagina and down into pelvic basin into rectouterine recess (Pouch de Douglas)
- Sweeps up and back onto rectum and posterior abdominal wall
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/GajTNze.png =350x)

#### Male pelvic peritoneum: pelvic space
- Starts from superior border of pubic symphysis
- Continues backwards and dips b/t urinary bladder and rectum, reflection forms wide rectovesical pouch
    - Lines back of seminal vesicle and prostate (but does not invest them)
- Sweeps up and backwards to plaster rectum and post abdominal wall
- ![](https://teachmeanatomy.info/wp-content/uploads/Rectovesical-Pouch.jpg =350x)

### Pelvic vessels
- Internal iliac (hypogastric) arteries and veins
    - Principle vessels of pelvis, originate at bifurcation of common iliac into internal and external branches
- Internal iliac (hypogastric) atery separated from sacroiliac joint by internal iliac (hypogastric) vein and lumbosacral trunk (L4+5)
- Vessels descend:
    - Posteromedially and inferiorly to reach pelvic viscera in lesser pelvis
    - Medial to external iliac artery and vein and obturator nerve
    - Lateral to peritoneum
- All arteries enter pelvis extraperitoneally and may be safely ligated in surgery
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/4jsusT6.png =250x)

#### Internal iliac artery
- Internal iliac branches (visceral/parietal) supply:
    - Most blood to pelvic viscera
    - Some blood to msuculoskeletal pelvis
    - Further branches to perineum and gluteal region
- Artery usually ends at superior edge of greater sciatic foramen by dividing into anterior and posterior divisions (remember 3); course is variable
    - Posterior division: 3 parietal branches
    - Anterior division: 3 (or 4) parietal branches, 3 visceral branches
- Key branches of internal iliac artery:
    - Superior gluteal artery passes through greater sciatic foramen
    - Inferior gluteal artery enters foramen below piriformis muscle and gives off superior and inferior veiscal artery and obturator artery before entering foramen
- 2 unpaired arteries in pelvis, median/middle sacral artery and superior rectal artery

#### 3 major vessels of venous drainage of pelvis
- Correspond to the major pelvic arteries:
    1. External iliac vein
    2. Internal iliac vein
    3. Common iliac vein
- ![](https://teachmeanatomy.info/wp-content/uploads/Venous-drainage-of-the-Pelvis.jpg =250x)

### Pelvic nerves
- Piriformis and coccygeus muscles are beds for sacral and coccygeal plexuses
    - S2 and S3 emerge b/t muscles
- At pelvic brim, L4 unites w/ L5 to form lumbosacral trunk that joins sacral plexus inferiorly
- Pudendal nerve of sacral plexus: main nerve of perineum and chief sensory nerve of external genitalia
    - Leaves pelvis (w/ internal pudendal artery) through greater sciatic foramen b/t piriformis and coccygeus, hooks around ischial spine and sacrospinous ligament, etners perineum through lesser sciatic foramen
