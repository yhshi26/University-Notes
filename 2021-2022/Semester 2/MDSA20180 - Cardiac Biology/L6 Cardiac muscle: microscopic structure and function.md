## Histology of the heart
- Inner layer: endocardium
- Middle layer: myocardium (contains cardiac muscle)
- Outer layer: epicardium

## Cardiac muscle
- Mostly located in heart (some in pulmonary vein and vena cavae)
- Branched cells
    - approx 85-100 micrometers long and 15-20 micrometers in diameter
- 1 or 2 nuclei (centrally located)
- Adjacent cells are connected by intercalated discs that provide anchorage and electrical communication
- Actin and myosin arranged into sarcomeres, hence cells are striated (similar to skeletal muscle)
- Contraction is under involuntary control i.e. cardiac muscle has an intrinsic contractile function that is modified by hormonal and neural stimuli (similar to smooth muscle)

### Myocardium contents
- Contractile cardiac myocytes (T-tubule system, lipid droplets containing triglycerides, glycogen granules, a lot of mitochondria; atrial vs centricular: T-tubules are smaller and fewer)
- Fibroblasts, connective tissue
- Blood vessels (e.g. rich capillary network)
- Nerves (autonomic and sensory)
- Pacemaker cells (e.g. sinoatrial node)
- Secretory cells (secrete atrial natriueretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide)
- Cardiac conduction system cells (e.g. Purkinje fibers: cells are larger than contractile myoctyes, have peripheral myofibrils/pale staining, are connected by gap junctions and desmosomes)

### Intercalated discs
- Gap junctions act as "electrical synapses" by providing ionic continuity between adjacent cells; located in longitudinally oriented regions of discs; built from connexins; cardiac muscle is a "functional syncitium"
- Desmosomes and fascia adherens bind adjacent cells together; located in transverse regions of discs

## Cardiac myocyte contraction
- Cardiac muscle contraction is triggered by an action potential at sarcolemma
    - Cytosolic [Ca^2+^] increases
    - Ca^2+^ binding to thin filament (toponin) regulated cross-bridge cycling
- Troponin and tropomyosin have the same functions as in skeletal muscle
- Ca^2+^ binds to troponin C, the Ca^2+^-binding subunit of troponin
- Contraction of cardiac myocytes requires binding of Ca^2+^ ions to troponin which enables interaction of actin and myosin filaments (similar to skeletal muscle)

## Summary
- Cardiac muscle is striated, branched and interconnected via intercalated discs
- Intercalated discs contain gap junctions (which provide electrical communication) and desmosomes and fascia adherens (which provide mechanical strength) 
- The sinoatrial node (SA node) is the normal pacemaker (spontaneous action potentials)
- Action potentials are rapidly transmitted via gap junctions
    - Coordinated contractile response
- Ca^2+^ enters the sarcoplasm through L-type Ca^2+^ channels and is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol via ryanodine receptors
- SR Ca^2+^ release into the cytosol mainly accounts for the rise in cytosolic [Ca^2+^] 
- Ca^2+^ binding to thin filament (troponin) regulates cross-bridge cycling

## Questions
- Which Ca2+ stores are used for the contractile responses of skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscles?
- How do action potentials differ in skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscles?
- Where is the regulatory site of action for Ca2+ in skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscles? 
- Tip: Look at tables 9.6 in Vander’s Human Physiology, 10.1 in Junqueira’s Basic Histology, 6.1 in Wheater’s Functional Histology  and 8.1 in Human Physiology to make a start on your considerations of these questions and other differences between the 3 muscle types
