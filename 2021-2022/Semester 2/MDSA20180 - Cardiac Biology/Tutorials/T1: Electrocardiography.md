Explore your 12-lead ECG. Begin the practical by identification of the  parts of the ECG waveform (P, Q, R, S and  T)  in  leads  I,  II,  III,  aVR, aVL,  aVF,  and  V1  to  V6,  to familiarise  yourself  with  the variety of QRS complex waveforms. 
 
## Questions
Examine your 12-lead ECG and perform the following tasks. 
 
1. Determine the heart rate.
    - HR = 300/# large boxes (5 mm or 0.2 s between 2 successive QRS complexes)
    - HR = 300/45 = 67 bpm
 
2. Determine whether the cardiac rhythm is regular (describing how you did this).
    - The cardiac rhythm is regular as the distances of R-R or P-P intervals remain relatively constant. This an be confirmed using a shifting paper method (draw 2 lines on a paper measuring distance of 1 interval, shift to confirm all intervals follow the same distance).
 
3. How do you know this is normal sinus rhythm? 
    - This is a normal sinus rhythm as there is a regular rhythm and constant rate.
 
4. Is the heart rate absolutely constant? If not, why not? 
 
 
5. Determine the ECG intervals and compare them with the normal ranges. 


    | Interval | Value(s) | Normal range(s)| 
    | -------- | -------- | -------- |
    | RR interval | | 0.6-1.0 | 
    | PR interval | | 0.12-0.2 |
    | QRS interval | | 0.08-0.10 | 
    | QT interval | | 0.33-0.43 |
    | QTc interval | | <0.44 | 

    The QT interval normally decreases as heart rate increases. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate and is calculated by dividing the QT interval by the square root of the R-R interval (thus, QTc = QT/√RR). 
 
6. Compare the ECG intervals in the supine  position with those obtained about 15 seconds after standing. 

    | Interval | Supine | Standing| 
    | -------- | -------- | -------- |
    | RR interval | | | 
    | PR interval | | | 
    | QRS interval | | | 
    | QT interval | | | 
    | QTc interval | | | 
 
7. Determine the mean frontal plane QRS axis in the supine position. Perform this calculation using the Einthoven’s triangle, as described in the practical notes. 
 
8. Note that the value obtained would differ according to posture. Why would you expect this value to differ? 
 
9. Why would you expect a different value if you calculated the QRS axis for a different plane? 
 
10. Which heart sound should occur just after commencement of the QRS complex of the ECG? 
 
11.  If  the  PR  interval  is  abnormally  long,  where  in  the  heart  would  you  expect  there  to  be  a conduction problem? 
 
12. If the PR interval is abnormally short, what might this indicate? 
 
13. What might cause an abnormally long QRS duration? 
 
14. When QT interval is prolonged, do you think the problem is with depolarization or repolarization of the ventricular muscle cells? 
 
15. What might cause an abnormally large QRS complex? 
 
16. What would you suspect if a large QRS complex is accompanied by left axis deviation? 
 
17. What might cause right axis deviation?
