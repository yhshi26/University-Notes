## Objectives
The objectives are:
- To illustrate the basic physiological mechanisms involved in the control of heart rate;
- To introduce the tests most commonly used in the clinical assessment of autonomic function.

## Background
The major determinant of heart rate is the level of activity in the autonomic nerves supplying the sino-atrial node. These are parasympathetic efferents, which travel from the brain stem to the heart via the vagus nerve, and sympathetic efferents, which originate in the spinal cord, and synapse in the stellate ganglion on their way to the heart.

The parasympathetic fibres release acetylcholine which binds to muscarinic receptors to bring about an immediate decrease in heart rate (negative chronotropic effect).

The sympathetic fibres release noradrenaline which binds to Î²1 receptors and acts rather slowly (10-15 seconds for peak effect) to increase heart rate (positive chronotropic effect).

The parasympathetic and sympathetic fibres are constantly active. This is referred to as parasympathetic tone and sympathetic tone, respectively (tone = tonic activity =
constant activity). They compete to influence the heart rate. Under normal circumstances the parasympathetic effect dominates which keeps the heart rate lower (~70 beats per minute, i.e ~70bpm) than the rate at which the sino-atrial node would naturally discharge in the absence of neural or hormonal influences (~100 bpm). As a result of their rapid influence (as opposed to the slower acting sympathetic fibres) changes in the tone of the parasympathetic fibres is the only mechanism which can bring about a sudden or rapid increase in heart rate.

The activity of vagal and sympathetic efferent fibres to the heart is controlled by complex neural circuitry in the medulla oblongata. These neural circuits are under a
wide variety of influences, which include; 
- Sensory receptors which monitor the state of the cardiovascular system, such as
    - Systemic arterial pressure (the arterial baroreceptors)
    - Chemical composition of the arterial blood (the arterial chemoreceptors)
    - Mechanical and chemical state of the myocardium (atrial and ventricular receptors)
- The respiratory control system (remember the respiratory and cardiovascular systems work together to transport oxygen and carbon dioxide), which includes
    - The central respiratory pattern generator, the neural circuits in the medulla oblongata that drive breathing, also influence parasympathetic and sympathetic discharge
    - Pulmonary stretch receptors, sensory receptors which monitor the volume of air in the lungs, also influence cardiac autonomic nerve activity
- Higher brain centres, including the hypothalamus and limbic system, to create the cardiovascular responses to emotion, fear, cold, hunger etc.

The most important of these influences is the input from afferent fibres from systemic arterial baroreceptors, located in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. These afferent
(sensory) fibres increase their discharge if systemic arterial pressure increases. This causes reflex responses (the baroreflex) to reduce blood pressure back to normal
levels. The reflex responses to an increase in systemic arterial pressure include;
- An increase in parasympathetic activity to the SA node to bring about an immediate decrease in heart rate
- A decrease in sympathetic activity to the SA node to bring about a slower
- A decrease in sympathetic activity to the ventricles to reduce the force of ventricular contraction (negative inotropic effect)
- A decrease in sympathetic activity to blood vessels so that they dilate, reducing their resistance to blood flow.

The procedures described in this practical are of interest themselves because they illustrate some important physiological regulatory mechanisms as well as being used clinically to test the functioning of the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system influences a wide variety of physiological systems so there is a correspondingly wide variety of clinical tests to assess autonomic function. However, the most widely employed tests are concerned with autonomic control of heart rate or systemic arterial pressure as these are simple to record non-invasively using equipment which is widely available. The procedures below are three of the five most commonly used tests of autonomic function. 
- Heart rate response to the Valsalva manoeuvre
- Heart rate response to deep breathing
- Heart rate and blood pressure responses to standing
- Heart rate and blood pressure response to isometric exercise
- Heart rate and blood pressure responses to skin chilling (the cold pressor test)

In this practical you will perform the first three of these and explore the physiological mechanisms underlying the responses observed.

| Period | Time (sec) | R-R interval (sec) | Heart rate (bpm) |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Normal | -60 | | 64.1 |
| | -45 | | 67.5 |
| | -30 | | 58.8 |
| | -15 | | 69.8 |
| | 0 | | 69.7 |
| Valsalva | | Record R-R interval for 40 sec | |
| Normal | 50 | | 65.5 |
| | 60 | | 73.9 |
| | 90 | | 65.8 |
| | 120 | | 65.9 |

## Heart rate response to deep breathing
The volunteer remains seated throughout. Record the ECG for one minute. The subject is then asked to breathe slowly for one minute at a rate of six breaths per minute (5 seconds in, 5 seconds out). The subject then relaxes and breathes normally for a period of one minute.
  
| Period | Time (sec) | Heart rate (bpm) |
| ------ | ---------- | -------- |
| Normal | -60 | 73.8 |
| | -45 | 80.2 |
| | -30 | 73.7 | 
| | -15 | 63 |
| | 0 | 62.1 | 
| Inspiration | 5 | 64.7 |
| Expiration | 10 | 68.7 |
| Inspiration | 15 | 59.7 |
| Expiration | 20 | 69.2 |
| Inspiration | 25 | 60.6 |
| Expiration | 30 | 70.7 |
| Inspiration | 35 | 74.4 |
| Expiration | 40 | 78.9 |
| Inspiration | 45 | 86.5 |
| Expiration | 50 | 70 |

| Normal | 75 | 74.8 |
| | 90 | 85.2 |
| | 105 | 61.2 | 
| | 120 | 66.9 |

## Heart rate responses to standing
The volunteer is asked to lie supine upon the bed for 7 minutes and then the data acqusition is begun. The subject then moves to the standing position unaided as quickly as possible and the recording is continued for a further five minutes.

Record the changes in heart rate

| | -30 | 64.2 |
| | -15 | 79.3 |
| | 0 | 61 |
| Standing | 5 | 85.7 |
| | 10 | 93 |
| | 15 | 83.3 |
| | 20 | 78.7 |
| | 25 | 81.4 |
| | 30 | 72 |
| | 35 | 94 |
| | 40 | 80.1 |
| | 50 | 82.1 |
| | 60 | 87.4 |
| | 90 | 98 |
| | 120 | 94.3 |
