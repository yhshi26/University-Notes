# Cardiac biology: past papers (SAQs)
###### tags: `MDSA20180 - Cardiac Biology`
Answer one question from each section. Each question should take approximately 30 minutes and account for 25% of final grade each.

## Paper 1
### SECTION A
1. Compare and contrast the gross anatomical features of the left and right ventricles of the heart.
2. Describe the sequence of events involved in the baroreceptor reflex alteration of heart rate in response to a decrease in mean arterial pressure.

### SECTION B
3. Define the term ‘mean frontal QRS axis of the heart’ and describe how the limb lead recordings of an electrocardiogram can be used to determine this axis. Include an appropriate diagram in your response.
4. Discuss the changes in ventricular volume and pressure throughout the cardiac cycle, and how this relates to electrical activity during the ECG. 

## Paper 2
### SECTION A
1. List the structures supplied by the left coronary artery. What is meant by coronary dominance?
2. Explain the role of the parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic nervous system during the performance of the Valsalva manoeuver and describe what cardiovascular change can occur.

### SECTION B
3. Explain the term ‘mean frontal QRS axis of the heart’, and describe how the bipolar limb lead recordings of an electrocardiogram can be used to determine this axis. Include an appropriate diagram in your response.
4. Discuss the short-term compensatory response(s) associated with maintaining normal mean arterial blood pressure following moving from a supine to standing position.

## Paper 3
### SECTION A
1. Draw a fully labelled illustration of the heart viewed from the front with the rightatrium opened. Indicate with a curved arrow the route blood takes in the foetalheart.
2. The Valsalva manoeuvre demonstrates the reactivity of the autonomic nervoussystem. Discuss this statement with reference to the changes in heart rate, cardiac output and blood pressure that occur during and just after the Valsalva manoeuvre.

### SECTION B
3. Describe two independent methods that can be used to detect myocardial tissue damage in patients.
4. Describe the action potential of a ventricular muscle (fast response) cell. Include in your response a labelled diagram which identifies the phases of the action potential and a discussion of the ionic currents that contribute to those electrical events.

## Paper 4
### SECTION A
1. Compare and contrast the gross anatomical features of the left and right ventricles of the heart.
2. Describe the sequence of events involved in the baroreceptor reflex alteration of heart rate in response to a decrease in mean arterial pressure.

### SECTION B
3. Discuss the changes in ventricular volume and pressure throughout the cardiac cycle, and how this relates to electrical activity during the ECG.
4. Discuss the mechanisms leading to shortness of breath (dyspnea) in patients with heart failure. In your response consider the effects of heart failure on pressures and volumes in the heart and the vasculature.

## Paper 5
### SECTION A
1. Draw a fully labelled illustration showing the venous drainage of the heart (cardiac veins).
2. The Valsalva Manoeuvre can be used to evaluate the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Describe the changes in pressure and heart rate that occur during this manoeuvre. Explain the role of the 2 branches of the ANS during these changes.

### SECTION B
3. Describe what information the waves and intervals of an Electrocardiogram (ECG) provide about the function of a normal healthy heart. Illustrate your response with an appropriate graph.
4. Describe the action potential and pacemaker potential of a pacemaker cell in the sinoatrial node. Include in your response an account of the ion channels and ion currents that contribute to those electrical events.

## Paper 6
### SECTION A
1. Describe the route taken by coronary blood as it supplies the chambers of the heart.
2. Illustrate the route of propagation of the cardiac impulse as it travels from sino-atrial node to the apex of the heart.

### SECTION B
3. Describe and discuss the effects of a Valsalva manoeuvre on arterial blood pressure.
4. Describe and explain the signals recorded in an Electrocardiogram (ECG). Comment on clinical information that can be obtained by an ECG.

### SECTION C
5. Discuss the role of the autonomic nervous system in the control of the contractile force of the heart.
6. Describe the changes in left atrial, left ventricular, and aortic pressure during a cardiac cycle. Include an appropriate diagram in your response.

## Paper 7 
### SECTION A
1. Discuss the development and clinical consequences of Tetralogy of Fallot.
2. Describe the method used in the electrocardiography practical and tutorial to determine the mean frontal QRS axis of the heart. Include an appropriate graph in your response.

### SECTION B
3. Cardiac output is influenced by Starling's Law of the Heart and cardiac contractility. Compare and contrast those two properties of cardiac muscle. Include in your response brief descriptions of the mechanisms responsible for the two properties.
4. Discuss the short-term compensatory response(s) associated with maintaining normal mean arterial blood pressure following moving from a supine to standing position.

## Paper 8
### SECTION A
1. Compare and contrast the structure of cardiac muscle with that of skeletal and smooth muscle
2. Write an account of the coronary circulation. Describe briefly and specifically how blockage in the main stem or branches of the right coronary artery might present clinically

### SECTION B
3. Explain the term ‘mean frontal QRS axis of the heart’, and describe how the bipolar limb lead recordings of an electrocardiogram can be used to determine this axis. Include an appropriate diagram in your response.
4. Outline the major metabolic pathways used by cardiac muscle to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Include a brief description of the function of creatine phosphokinase (CK).

### SECTION C
5. Describe the sequence of events involved in the baroreceptor reflex alteration of heart rate in response to a decrease in mean arterial pressure.
6. A 32 year old female patient presents to her GP feeling light headedness and dizzy. Discuss how the GP will measure her Blood Pressure (BP) using the ausculatory method. The patient has a BP of 95/52 mmHg and is not pregnant. Discuss what these values mean, and whether you think this patient has normal BP or hypertension/hypotension. What are the likely causes of her symptoms and how might she be treated.

## Paper 9
### SECTION A
1. Discuss the development and clinical consequences of Tetralogy of Fallot.
2. Describe the method used in the electrocardiography practical and tutorial to determine the mean frontal QRS axis of the heart. Include an appropriate graph in your response.

### SECTION B
3. Cardiac output is influenced by Starling's Law of the Heart and cardiac contractility. Compare and contrast those two properties of cardiac muscle. Include in your response brief descriptions of the mechanisms responsible for the two properties.
4. Discuss the short-term compensatory response(s) associated with maintaining normal mean arterial blood pressure following moving from a supine to standing position.
