# Cardiac biology: past papers (SAQs)
###### tags: `MDSA20180 - Cardiac Biology`
Answer one question from each section. Each question should take approximately 30 minutes and account for 25% of final grade each.

## Paper 1
### SECTION A
1. Compare and contrast the gross anatomical features of the left and right ventricles of the heart.
2. Describe the sequence of events involved in the baroreceptor reflex alteration of heart rate in response to a decrease in mean arterial pressure.

### SECTION B
3. Define the term ‘mean frontal QRS axis of the heart’ and describe how the limb lead recordings of an electrocardiogram can be used to determine this axis. Include an appropriate diagram in your response.
4. Discuss the changes in ventricular volume and pressure throughout the cardiac cycle, and how this relates to electrical activity during the ECG. 

## Paper 2
### SECTION A
1. List the structures supplied by the left coronary artery. What is meant by coronary dominance?
2. Explain the role of the parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic nervous system during the performance of the Valsalva manoeuver and describe what cardiovascular change can occur.

### SECTION B
3. Explain the term ‘mean frontal QRS axis of the heart’, and describe how the bipolar limb lead recordings of an electrocardiogram can be used to determine this axis. Include an appropriate diagram in your response.
4. Discuss the short-term compensatory response(s) associated with maintaining normal mean arterial blood pressure following moving from a supine to standing position.

## Paper 3

## Paper 8
### SECTION A
1. Compare and contrast the structure of cardiac muscle with that of skeletal and smooth muscle
2. Write an account of the coronary circulation. Describe briefly and specifically how blockage in the main stem or branches of the right coronary artery might present clinically

### SECTION B
3. Explain the term ‘mean frontal QRS axis of the heart’, and describe how the bipolar limb lead recordings of an electrocardiogram can be used to determine this axis. Include an appropriate diagram in your response.
4. Outline the major metabolic pathways used by cardiac muscle to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Include a brief description of the function of creatine phosphokinase (CK).

### SECTION C
5. Describe the sequence of events involved in the baroreceptor reflex alteration of heart rate in response to a decrease in mean arterial pressure.
6. A 32 year old female patient presents to her GP feeling light headedness and dizzy. Discuss how the GP will measure her Blood Pressure (BP) using the ausculatory method. The patient has a BP of 95/52 mmHg and is not pregnant. Discuss what these values mean, and whether you think this patient has normal BP or hypertension/hypotension. What are the likely causes of her symptoms and how might she be treated.
