# Heart: surfaces and chambers
## Learning objectives
- Describe the anatomical position and orientation of the heart
- Describe the anatomy and structure of the pericardium
- Define the surfaces and borders of the heart
- Describe the anatomy of the four heart chambers

## Heart structure
### Heart has 4 chambers, 2 sides
- Left and right atriums and ventricles
- Left side pumps blood around body
- Right side receives deoxygenated blood
- If we have a cardiac output at rest of 5L/ min we must also have a venous return of 5L/ min 
    - If venous return is changed in any way it will have an effect on blood flow

### Heart anterior side
- Heart viewed from the front (recommended to practice drawing it to learn)
    - Superior vena cava and inferior vena cava (rather short)
    - Right atrium
    - Right ventricle
        - Most of what is in front is the right ventricle
        - Stab wounds most likely effect right ventricle
    - Left ventricle
        - Only small bit showing
    - Base of pulmonary artery is anterior to the aorta
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/iqYsSFI.png =300x)

### Sinuses
#### Transverse pericardial sinus 
- Formed as a result of folding of the heart tube in an embryo
- Separates the arterial vessels and the venous vessels
    - Located posteriorly to the ascending aorta and anteriorly to the SVC
    - Superior to the left atrium 
- Surgical significance: with 1 motion, can pass finger through and locate and ligate (tie off) coronary arteries during coronary artery bypass
    - In an emergency, can rapidly put person on a bypass circuit 
    - If you can control fthese 2 vessels, can control the whole circuit of blood
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/hAdgXAS.png =300x)

#### Oblique sinus
- Found on posterior surface
- J-shaped surrounding the SVC, IVC and pulmonary veins
- A hand placed under the apex moving superiorly would slip into the oblique sinus
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/AP57210.png =300x)

## Location
### Mediastinum
- Heart is located in the mediastinum which can be divided into 2 major parts
    - Superior and inferior
- Inferior has 3 parts
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/C2YJ1XS.png =350x)

### Surface anatomy
- Manubriosternal joint = "angle of louis" = sternal angle
    - The synarthrotic joint formed by articulation of the manubrium (top of sternum) and the body of the sternum
    - Located at 2nd costal cartilage
    - Palpable clinical landmark
        - You can feel the angle of louis and while examining a patient you can know that this is the start of the second intercostal space
        - You can then count down to the 5th and this is the location of the apex of the heart
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Dotrmtd.png =400x)

### Surrounding pericardium
- Tough fibrous sac
- Filled with lubricating fluid
- Encases heart with a number of layers each made of a single sheet of epithelial cells
    1. Outermost layer of pericardium: fibrous layer
        - Can't be strecthced: non complient, inextensible sac
    2. Parietal layer of serous pericardium
        - Lines internal surface of fibrous pericardium
    3. Layer of serous fluid
    4. Visceral layer of serous pericardium (epicardium)
        - Outer layer of chamber of heart
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ieZSYGw.png =400x)
- Ligaments of pericardium stabilise heart and minimise jolts (applied mechanical forces on the heart can interfere with rhythm and hence need to be minimised):
    1. Phreno-pericardial ligaments: tether heart to diaphragm
    2. Superior sterno-pericardial ligaments: attach pericardium to surface of sternum
    3. Xipho-pericardial ligaments: attach right ventrical to xiphoid process
    4. Vertebro-pericardial ligaments

## Orientation
- 1/3 on right side of the body, 2/3 on the left 
- Long axis lies parallel to the interventricular septum
- Short axis is perpendicular to the long axis at the level of the atrioventricular valve

## Clinical considerations
### Cardiac tamponade
- If heart fills with blood or fluid the pericardial sac will not stretch to accommodate
    - Causes are varied including haemopericardium (blood in pericardium which is expected from trauma) and pericarditis
- Rigidity means that the heart is subject to resulting increased pressure 
- Can compress blood vessels entering and leaving heart compromising cardiac output 
- Serious life threatening 
    - Increasingly common to carry ultrasound probes to see if there is a lot of fluid in the pericardial sac making it easier to diagnose 
- Becks triad describes the signs 
    1. Low BP 
    2. Muffled heart sounds when listening with stethoscope 
    3. Distension of jugular vein 
- Chest x-ray for this can show the “water bottle sign”
    - Shape shown from x-ray looks like a water bottle shape: not showing shape of the heart but of the pericardium with the heart in the fluid somewhere 
- Emergency treatment is to make a drain

### Pericarditis
- Inflammation of the pericardium 
- Conditions can cause the serous fluid to increase 
    - Linked with bacterial infection and myocardial infarction 
- Painful condition linked with a distinctive posture (classic sign) 
    - Sat up leaned over their knees which makes the pain less by minimising load of the tendons of pericardium
    - Most painful position is to lie out flat as it stretches ligaments due to gravity of the heart

## Heart: breakdown
- Described as a pyramid that has fallen on its side 
- Apex 
    - Tip of the left ventricle located approx. directly down from mid clavical 
        - 5th left intercostal space at the mid-clavicular line 
    - When contracting the heart rotates a little bit and the apex hits off the chest wall
    - This is what you can feel when feeling chest for heart beat 
    - If the heart is enlarged the apex beat could be much further over 
- Base 
    - Mainly left atrium 
    - Anterior to the oesophagus 
        - To monitor activity of left atrium can often be done through the oesophagus 
- Surfaces (3D concept) 
    - Right pulmonary surface: mainly RA 
    - Left pulmonary surface: LV 
        - Leaves cardiac impression on left lung 
    - Anterior/ sternocostal surface: RV
    - Inferor/ diaphragmatic surface: mainy LV 
        - Rests above central tendon of diaphragm
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/PdPsEiF.png =350x)
- 4 borders (2D concept)
    - Left: mainly left ventrical (LV)
    - Right: right atrium (RA) between superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC)
    - Superior: RA, LA, auricles and great vessels
    - Inferior: mainly RV plus some LV

### Transverse section through atria
![](https://i.imgur.com/X6Q5FyO.png =400x)
- Pulmonary vessels enter at this level
- There is a right and left auricle
    - Atrium = upper heart chambers; auricle = ear like conical muscular pouch that arise from each atrium 
    - Auricles consist of pectinate muscles 
        - Pectinate muscles are parallel ridges in walls of the atria of the heart 
        - In ventricles there are trabeculae carneae which are irregular rather than parallel 
    - Between pectinate muscles and smooth muscle is crista terminalis, a smooth muscular ridge between the 2 layers

### Features in chambers
#### Right atrium
- Opening of IVC
- Annulus fossae ovalis: ring shape structure 
    - Prominent rounded margin of fossa ovalis 
- Fossa ovalis: oval shaped depression
    - During development there is no point of using lungs as they are full of fluid 
    - Body develops ways to bypass lungs by moving blood straight from left to right ventricle
    - Before birth this closes up and we are left with fossa ovalis in the interatrial septum 
    - Patent Foramen Ovale
        - Congenital defect resulting in hole not closing and then called patent foramen ovale
        - Results in potential for right-to-left shunt between the two atria 
    - Opening of coronary sinus 
        - Coronary sinus is a collection of veins joined together to form a large vessel that collects blood from the heart muscle and delivers it to the right artrium 
    - Tricuspid valve 
        - 3 cusp valve allowing flow from RA to RV
    - Preferential streaming of blood from the SVC and IVC into right atrium 
        - SVC blood towards tricuspid 
        - IVC blood toward the fossa ovalis 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/lz3bWgN.png =450x)

#### Right ventricle
- Attached to cusps of tricuspid valve are the chordae tendinae 
    - Attach to papillary muscles 
    - The 3 right ventricular papillary muscles originate in ventricular wall and attach to anterior, posterior and septal cusps of the tricuspid valve vie chordae tendinae
- Moderator band 
    - A band of muscle which carries part of the conducting system of the right bundle branch to the anterior papillary muscle 
    - Right bundle branch is a division of the atrioventricular bundle (bundle of His) from the conducting system of the heart 
- Trabeculae carneae: rounded irregular muscular columns which project from the inner surface of the left and right ventricles of the heart 
- Pulmonary valve 
    - Valve between RV and pulmonary artery 
    - 3 cusps 
    - Semilunar valve (1 of 2)
- Conus arteriosus oextension of the right ventricle in the heart from which pulmonary artery originates
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/VIPG5pT.png =400x)

#### Left atrium
- Fossa ovalis 
- Left atrial appendage 
    - Extension of the left atrium that pumps oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left ventricle 
- Mitral valve (bicuspid valve) 
    - Valve between left atrium and LV allowing filling of LV 
    - 2 cusps 
- Pulmonary vein ostia 
    - Right and left pulmonary veins enter the posterior left atrial wall transporting oxygenated blood from the lungs to LA
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/5B1IM13.png =300x)

#### Left ventricle
- Much thicker than right V in an adult 
    - About 2-3x thicker than RV
    - Allows for high pressure to send blood around the body 
    - Important for RV to not be too strong as is getting sent to really tiny alveoli in the lungs which are fragile: pressure needs to be strong enough to drive flow but not to damage the small structures 
- Aortic valve 
    - Between left ventricle and aorta allowing blood to be ejected from LV into aorta 
    - Semilunar valve (2 of 2) 
    - 3 cusps 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/EiemlSD.png =250x)

## Work calculations
- Pressure x volume = work of the heart
- To increase work of the heart you increase pressure or volume 
- If there is long standing high blood pressure the heart will be “pressure loaded”
    - Ventricle gets much thicker inwards 
    - The work the heart is doing will be much greater which can result in heart failure 
- Can have a mixture of pressure and volume load in the heart

# Heart: valves and conducting tissues
## Learning objectives
- Describe anatomy and fucntion of valves of haert
- Understand structure and function of fibrous skeleton of heart
- Describe and understand cardiac conduction system

## Heart valves
- 2 valves to allow blood to pass from atria to respective ventricles = atrioventricular valve
    - Mitral and tricuspid valve 
        - Mitral valve: between left atrium and left ventricle 
        - Tricuspid valve: between right atrium and right ventricle 
    - 2 semilunar valves that allow blood to pass from ventricles to: 1. lungs, 2. rest of body 
        1. Pulmonary valve: between right ventricle and pulmonary artery 
        2. Aortic valve: between left ventricle and aorta

### Aortic valve
- Ventricular contraction = valve open
- Semilunar valve
    - The other is pulmonary valve 
- 3 half moon shaped cusps 
    - Open silently, closure of valves is reason for heart sounds 
- Allows blood flow into aorta during ventricular contraction , prevents blood flow moving back in the opposite direction during ventricular relaxation 
    - Cusps are forced to close with recoil of blood from aorta after ventricle contracts filling the sinuses of the cusps 
        - Think of a dropper when you squeeze it first it expels liquid but when you let it relax it pulls liquid back in 
- Sometimes can be bicuspid 
- Calcification: valve starts to accumulate calcific deposits called aortic stenosis 
    - Thought to be genetic
    - Narrowing of the aortic valve opening restricting blood flow from the left ventricle tothe aorta
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/nAUlafg.png =120x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/vuiLDND.png =115x)

### Atrioventricular valves
- Ventricular contraction = valve closed 
- In general the design is the cups with tendons connecting to the papillary muscles 
    - Tendons to ensure that when the valves contracts that it closes properly 
- When ventricles are filling the valves are open 
    - Contraction of papillary muscles attached to cusps by chordae tendinae keeps valves closed during ventricular contraction and ensures the blood doesn’t push the cusps up and fill the atria 
- Opening and closing of these valves is passive: based on pressure 
    - When blood pressure in atrium is greater than in ventricle the valve is pushed open and blood flows from atrium → ventricle 
    - When ventricle is contracting and creates a stronger internal pressure it forces the valve closed 
- Right ventricle = tricuspid valve 
    - Anterior, inferior and septal cusps  
- Left ventricle = bicuspid = mitral valve 
    - Anteromedial cusp and posterolateral cusp
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/p2goIAQ.png =350x)
    - On this diagram you can also see anterior and posterior grooves 
        - Anterior and posterior interventricular sulcus
            - Groove separates ventricles of the heart
        - Coronary sulcus (not seen on this) 
            - Atria separated from ventricles by coronary sulcus 
    - More inferior into the RV you can see the moderator band  
        - Carries important impulse through side wall of RV

### Right atrioventricular valve = tricuspid valve
- Cusps of the right atrioventricular valve (tricuspid valve) attach to chordae tendinae
- Chordae tendinae extend to papillary muscles 
    - Chordae tendinae from 2 paillary muscle attach to each cusp preventing separation of cusps during ventricular contraction
- The inferior papillary muscle, anterior muscle and septal muscle 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/sqvoMg2.png =350x)

### Left atrioventricular valve = mitral valve
- Cusps are continuous with each other near their bases at sites called commissures in atrioventricular valves
- Myocardial infarction = lack of blood supply causing tissue damage 
    - When near the mitral valve can cause ripping of the papillary muscles 
        - Usually seen as a systolic murmur

### Surface anatomy for cardiac valves
- Aortic valve sends pulse to 3rd intercostal space 
    - Right ventricle relaxing
- Pulmonary valve pulse at other side of the sternum at 3rd intercostal space 
    - Left ventricle relaxing 
- Mitral valve sends pulse to apex of heart 
    - Left ventricle contracting
- Tricuspid valve sends pulse to 
    - Right ventricle contracting

## Auscultations
### Positioning stethoscope to ascultate valves
![](https://i.imgur.com/xHA0t35.png =450x)

### Heart sounds
- M1T1 ---- A2P2 
    - Lub ---- Dub
    - Mitral1,Tricuspid1 --- Aortic1,Pulmonary1 
- Valves of left heart close first by a very small amount
    - Left heart is activated first 
    - Bigger and conducting tissue is bigger 
- Normal heartbeat = simple lub dub
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/NJmpYND.png =250x)

#### Heart murmurs
- Aortic stenosis
- Didn't finish

## Fibrous skeleton
- Dense connective tissue 
- Electrical insulator
    - Insulates atria from ventricles 
- Structure and support 
    - Scaffolding present for cusps of valves 
- In cardiac cells they’re connected through gap junctions 
- Reason for pause between atria and ventricles contracting is that they are electrically insulated due to fibrous skeleton
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Emps2J0.png =250x)

## Conducting system
- Made of cardiac cells that have specialised features for heart excitation 
    - Network of cells = conducting system 
    - In electrical contact with cardiac muscle cells via gap junctions
- Initiates heartbeat and helps spread rapid impulse throughout the heart 
- Contraction of cardiac muscle is triggered by depolarisation of the plasma membrane
    - Initial excitation of 1 cell spreads rapidly due to gap junctions 
        - Gap junctions allow action potentials to jump from 1 cell to another 
- Initial depolarisation arises in a small group of conducting system cells: Sinoatrial (SA) node 
    - SA node = pacemaker of the heart 
    - Located in right atrium near entrance to SVC 
    - AP generated here spreads throughout the atria then into and throughout the ventricles 
    - SA node discharge rate determines the heart rate 
        - Heart rate = number of times heart contracts per minute 
- Spread of depolarisation is rapid enough that the two atria contract at the same time
- Spread of the action potential to the ventricles is more complicated 
- Link between atrial and ventricular conducting system = Atrioventricular (AV) node
    - Located at base of RA at Koch’s c
        - Koch’s Triangle = anatomical area of which its angles are
            1. Coronary sinus orifice 2. Tendon of Todaro 3. AV node -spreading of AP through RA causes depolarisation of the AV node -this node as a very important characteristic: the propagation of APs through the AV node is relatively slow
        - Delay allows atrial contraction to be completed before ventricular excitation occurs 
- After leaving AV node AP propagates down interventricular (IV) septum 
    - This pathway of conducting fibres = Bundle of His
    - AV node + Bundle of His = only connection of conducting system between atria and ventricles
- Bundle of His branches into right and left bundle branches in IV septum 
    - At apex of heart these branches enter walls of left and right ventricles 
    - Fibres make contact with purkinje fibres 
        - Large conducting cells 
        - Rapidly distribute impulse through much of the ventricles 
    - Purkinje fibres make contact with ventricular myocardial cells which spread the impulse through rest of ventricles 
- Rapid conduction along fibres cause depolarisation to happen nearly simultaneously → single coordinated contraction 
    - Apex contracts slightly earlier causing the blood to move upwards towards the valve for an efficient contraction
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/cJJmQv1.png =300x)
- Moderator band (also called septomarginal band) = muscular band that carries part of right bundle branch to the anterior papillary muscle 
    - Extends from inferior septum

### Cardiac action potentials
- Mechanism by which APs are conducted in membranes of heart cells is similar to other excitable tissues 
- Different types of heart cells express unique combinations of ion channels that produce different AP shapes 
    - Allows for specialisation of different roles in the spread of excitation through heart 
- Cardiac action potential takes a different form in different cardiac cells 
    - SA nodal cells, atrial muscle cells, AV nodal cells, Purkinje fibres, ventricular muscle cells 
- Cardiac ventricular AP shape shows rapid depolarisation and repolarisation 
    - Rapid upstroke (phase 0) caused by rapid opening of Na+ channels → depolarisation 
    - Followed by partial repolarisation (phase 1) caused by closing of the fast channels opening K^+^ channel
    - Membrane potential enters plateau phase (phase 2) due to inward Ca^2+^ currents 
    - Repolarisation phase (phase 3) occurs as Ca^2+^ channels inactivate and more K^+^ channels open and Na^+^ channels revert to closed state
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/kcmV6zH.png =350x)
- SA node = most excitable cells in the heart 
    - Has an unstable resting potential so instead undergoes a slow depolarisation 
        - Gradual depolarisation = pacemaker potential 
    - 3 mechanisms contribute to pacemaker potential:
        1. Progressive reduction in K^+^ permeability: K^+^ channels gradually close due to membrane’s return to negative potentials 
        2. Unique set of pacemaker channels called “funny” or F-type channels: open when the membrane potential is at negative values conducting a depolarising Na^+^ current
        3. T-type Ca^2+^ channels: Ca^2+^ channel that opens briefly but contributes to Ca^2+^ current and an important final depolarising boost to pacemaker potential

# Coronary circulation
## Learning objectives
- Know origin, course and supply of coronary arteries
- Describe venous drainage of heart via cardiac veins and coronary sinus
- Be aware of certain clinical aspects of coronary arteries

## Coronary circulation: circulation to the heart itself
![](https://i.imgur.com/313TBAw.png =350x)

### Aortic valve
- Similar structure to pulmonary valve
- 3 semilunar cusps (left, right, posterior (non-coronary)), with free edges that coapt during valve closure
- Pocket-like sinus in wall of ascending aorta behind each cusp
- Note: right and left coronary arteries originate from left and right aortic sinuses respectively
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/FI0bVkd.png =250x)

### Coronary arteries (supply of heart)
![](https://i.imgur.com/UfX0uBh.png =350x)

#### Right coronary artery
- Arise from right aortic sinus of ascending aorta
- Descends along AV groove/coronary sulcus (between right atrium/ventricle)
    - Branch to SA node
    - Right (acute) marginal artery (RMA) (does not reach apex)
    - Posterior descending artery (PDA) (also called posterior interventricular branch)
    - Branch to AV node (at crux of heart)
- Right coronary artery supplies:
    - Right atrium
    - Most of right ventricle
    - Part of left ventricle (diaphragmatic surface)
    - Part of IV septum (usually posterior 1/3)
    - SA node (60%)
    - AV node (80%)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/mO8EbTA.png =250x)

#### Interventricular septum
- Separates the left ventricle and the right ventricle
- Posterior 1/3 supply predominantly from right coronary artery
- Anterior 2/3 supply predominantly from left coronary artery
- Lateral section:
    - ![](https://www.guwsmedical.info/heart-failure/images/4415_31_65-interventricular-septum-blood-supply.jpg =300x)

#### Left coronary artery
- "Left main stem" arises from left aortic sinus of ascending aorta
- Descends along coronary sulcus posteriorly to pulmonary trunk
- 2 main branches:
    - Anterior interventricular branch (LAD)
        - Courses along anterior IV groove
        - Can give rise to 1 or more lateral branches (diagonal arteries)
        - Courses around apex to anastomose with posterior interventricular artery
    - Circumflex (Cx) artery/branch
        - Follows coronary sulcus
        - Gives rise to left (obtuse) marginal branch (or several marginals)
        - Normally terminates before reaching crux
- Left coronary artery supplies:
    - Left atrium
    - Most of left ventricle
    - Part of right ventricle
    - Most of IV septum (usually anterior 2/3 inc. AV bundle)
    - [SA node (40%)]
    - [AV node (20%)]
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/7nEXWeD.png =250x)

#### Coronary dominance
- "Dominance" of the coronary arterial system defined by the giving rise to the posterior interventricular branch/supply
- Right dominance is common
    - RCA (70%)
    - RCA + LCA (20%; co-dominance)
    - LCA (10%)
    - ![](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/thecoronarycirculation-180612133033/85/the-coronary-circulation-27-320.jpg?cb=1528810335 =250x)

### Coronary collateral circulation
- No major anastomoses between larger coronary essels
- Some collaterals exists among smaller branches, with potential for further development in cases of chronic arterial occlusion
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/KosQVG4.png =250x)

### Coronary veins (drainage of heart)
- Coronary sinus is the major venous drainage vessel of the heart
- Situated in posterior coronary sulcus
- Great cardiac vein, posterior cardiac vein, middle cardiac vein and small cardiac vein (4 major tributaries of coronary sinus) drain into coronary sinus
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/j6wJN4r.png =250x)
- Coronary sinus drains to right atrium
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/3dJYLdd.png =250x)

## Clinical observations
### Coronary artery disease
- Leading cause of death worldwide
- Accumulation of atherosclerotic plaqies
- Reduced blood flow to heart muscle
- Sudden chest pain (typically radiating to left arm or left side of neck)
- Affected artery can be stented/by-passed with autologous or synthetic graft

### Strategies
#### Angioplasty
- Involves manually widening narrowed or obstructed arteries
- Balloon catheter placed in artery over guide wire using minimally invasive surgery (percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI)
- Expanded to compress plaque and withdrawn
- ![](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/-/media/images/health/2_-treatment/cardiovascular/coronary-artery-disease-treatment/pcardio20140402v0001.ashx =250x)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/UXxi48D.png =250x)

#### Stenting
- Follows same steps as balloon angioplasty
- Stent crimped onto balloon expands during deployment to keep lumen open
- Restenosis can occur however (foreign body response)
- ![](https://www.cirse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Angioplasty600x440-600x440.jpg =250x)

#### Bypass grafting
- Occlusion of >70% generally requires bypass grafting to revascularize affected area
- Generally open heart surgery (median sternotomy) required and cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung machine)
- ![](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/inline-images/cabg-1.jpg =250x)

### Most common sites of occlusion
- Anterior IV (LAD branch) of LCA (40-50%) ("widowmaker")
- RCA (30-40%)
- Circumflex branch of LCA (15-20%)

# Embryology of the heart
## Learning objectives
- Know details of development of heart, including that of its inflow and outflow tract, valves, septae and chambers
- Understand the basic mechanism of folding and rotation fo heart during development
- Understand disorders of heart and embryogenesis

## Cardiac embryogenesis
- Cardiovascular system develops from splanchnic layer of lateral mesoderm 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/kmIbCXR.png =250x)
- Cardiovascular system = first major system to function in embryo
    - Necessary as rapidly growing embryo can no longer rely on diffusion for nutrients/oxygen
    - Primordial heart and vascular system appear in middle of 3rd week
    - Heart begins to beat at 22-23 days

### Cardiogenic field
- Cardiogenic region can be thought of as bilateral regions of primary heart cells that merge cranially to form horseshoe-shaped field 
    - Horseshoe-shaped field = primary crescent
- Cardiac progenitor cells migrate towards cranial end of embryo (beyond oropharyngeal membrane)
- Reside in splanchnic layer of lateral plate mesoderm
- Induced by endoderm to form paired angioblastic cords
- Canalise (hollow out) to form endocardial tubes (heart tubes)
- Blood islands appear in mesoderm (will form blood cells and vessels) e.g. 2 dorsal aortae
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/qJDbXPP.png =200x)

### Sequence of events 
- Occurs towards end of the 3rd week
- Day 18: cardiac precursor cells seen in form of blood islands 
- Day 20: first intraembryonic blood vessels seen 
- Day 21: folding, heart tube formation and looping 
- Day 22: heart starts to beat, ebb and flow initially
    - Heart beat not a true pulsatile type pattern and blood flow is more an “ebb and flow” pattern 
    - Ebb and flow pattern is when the flow slows down and speeds up 
- Day 28: embryonic circulation established 
- Week 8: fully functional, multi-chambered heart 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/u7OHDHP.png =350x)

## Blood formation
- Blood cells differentiate in mesoderm of yolk sac as blood islands 
- These islands are surrounded with endothelial sacs 
- Sacs then interconnect 
- Heart begins to beat and blood is driven through the meshwork 
- Where blood flow is fastest, blood vessels begin to form
- Blood formation then shifts to: 
    - The aorta 
    - Gonad 
    - Mesonephric region 
- Location of blood formation followed by the liver and spleen 
- Finally moves to bone marrow 
- Different haemoglobin types are necessary for the embryo, fetus and adult 

## Head fold
- With formation of the head fold (due to rapid growth of brain) the cardiogenic area changes position to within this longitudinal fold 
- Embryo folds longitudinally, heart and pericardial cavity move to cervical region and finally to thorax
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/kTOi5xI.png =200x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/zBlGtkl.png =200x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/lApIoXn.png =200x)
- Transverse folding of the embryo brings heart tubes into ventral midline allowing them to fuse to form single primordial heart tube (day 22)
    - Caudal regions of paired cardiac primordia (endocardial tubes) merge in midline to form single heart tube
    - Initially suspended from developing foreget by dorsal mesocardium
    - Transverse folding also forms pericardial cavity surrounding fusing heart tubes
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/e2SYRN4.png =350x)

### Heart tube
- After fusion, dilations appear in heart tube forming divisions (5):
    1. Trunchus arteriosus → pulmonary trunk & ascending aorta
    2. Bulbus cordis → right ventricle, right and left outflow tracts
    3. Primordial ventricle → left ventricle
    4. Primordial atrium → left and right atria
    5. Sinus venosus (left and right) horns → part of right atrium, left and right auricles, coronary sinus
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/fdCLPge.png =200x)
- Heart is able to push blood cranially from the sinus venosus 
- Atria and ventricles are not separated

#### Heart tube folding and rotation
- Allows straight heart tube to form more complex structure
- Most folding and rotation occurs in week 4, completes in week 5
- Summarised steps of folding and rotation: 
    1. Straight heart tube begins to elongate with simultaneous growth in the bulbus cordisand primitive ventricle 
    2. Causes heart to bend ventrally and rotate to the right forming a C-shaped loop with convex side situated on the right 
    3. Ventricular bend moves caudally (towards bottoms) and the distance between outflow and inflow tracts diminishes 
    4. The atrial and outflow poles converge and myocardial cells are added, forming the truncus arteriosus and forming S-shape
        - Atria moves to lie behind ventricles (S-shaped loop)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/XP2HuGl.png =450x)

##### Clinical anomaly: dextrocardia
- Normal (A): folding occurs ventricals ventrally and to the right, atriums dorsally and to the left
- Dextrocardia (B): folding occurs ventricals dorsally and to the left, atriums ventrally and to the right (backwards)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/CmzmmkD.png =300x)

## Endocardial cushions
- Subset of cells in the development of heart with vital role in formation of the heart septa 
- Form initial division of right and left atria and ventricles
    - Dorsal (posterior) and ventral (anterior) surfaces of AV canal 
- Mesenchymal cells from endocardium invade cushions allowing them to grow and fuse 
- Grow into canal
    - Meet and fuse to separate AV canal into R/L channels

### Ventricular septation
- Appearance of primordial muscular interventricular ridge
    - Develops in floor of ventricle near the apex 
- As either side of the ventricle grows and dilates the medial walls fuse forming the prominent IV septum 
- IV foramen = opening between cranial portion of IV septum and the endocardial cushions 
    - Closes by end of 7th week 
- 2 components
    - Superior membranes 
    - Inferior muscular
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/G6d5DBa.png =350x)
    
### Atrial septation
- AV junction
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/ePQ3RDP.png =350x)
- Septum primum begins to form from membranous tissue at the roof of the atrium 
    - Divides into R/L atria
    - Blood can still pass between
- Space between septum primum and endocardial cushions = foramen primum
- Perforations in septum primum due to apoptosis 
    - Produce the foramen secundum 
- Septum secundum forms immediately to the right of septum primum
    - Gradually overlaps the foramen secundum during 5/6 weeks
- Incomplete partition of the atrium by the septum secundum = foramen ovale
    - 2 membranes aren’t touching (septum primum and secondum)
    - Blood can flow through foramen ovale and out through foramen secundum into LA
        - Forms a right → left shunt 
        - Remaining portion of septum primum acts as a valve preventing backflow 
- Blood pressure in heart increases after birth
    - 2 membranes fuse together
    - Blood cannot flow from right to left anymore

## Clinical implications
- 80/10,000 live births have a heart abnormality
- ~40% liveborn babies with congenital anomalies
- How common are they? Of congenital heart defects
    - 4% single gene mutations
    - 6% chromosomal abnormalities
    - 5% exposure to teratogens
    - Remaining are unknown, multifactorial causes
- Different types: add up to more than 100% as more than one can be present at any one time
    - Ventricular septal defect (25-50%)
    - Atrial septal defect (10%) 
    - Tetralogy of fallot (10%) 
    - Patent ductus arteriosus (25%)
    - Coarctation of the aorta (10%) 

### Foetal circulation before birth
- FO allows blood to cross to LA, bypasses lungs
    - Not used in womb, don’t need blood supply
- Ductus arteriosus also cuts out lungs
- Normally both close after birth

### Foetal circulation after birth
- End of blood flow through umbilical circulation
    - Uses own circulation system 
- Lungs drain, circulatory bed expands
- Ductus arteriosus ceases to carry blood, diminishes, slowly closes
- FO closes

### Ventricular septal defects
- Can involve membranous (more serious) or muscular part (can resolve as child grows)
- Blood crosses heart initially L – R
- Similar to ASDs, can overburden right heart and lungs leading to:
    - Pulmonary hypertension
    - Right heart failure 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/4Z0tRPd.png =250x)

### Atrial septal defect
- May be associated with trisomy 21
- If minor (small), can be asymptomatic (doesn't cause problems)
- If major (large), can cause extra blood to overfill the lungs and pulmonary hypertension, increasing workload on right heart
- May be closed by catheterisation
- ![](https://assets.aboutkidshealth.ca/akhassets/Hearts_CHD/Atrial_Septal_Defect.jpg?renditionid=21 =300x)

### Tetralogy of fallot
- Unequal division of outflow tract, displacement of conotruncal septum
    - Narrow right ventricular outflow region (pulmonary stenosis)
    - Ventricular septal defect (VSD)
    - Overriding (misplaced) aorta (lies over VSD)
    - Right ventricular hypertrophy
- Symptoms:
    - Oxygen-poor blood flows to body (cyanosis, shortness of breath)
    - Respiratory distress (dyspnea), with rapid breathing
    - Characteristic squatting posture, at rest, to relieve dyspnea (increases blood flow to lungs)
    - Coeur en sabot (boot-shaped heart) in x-ray
    - Cyanosis develops gradually, with intermittent severe “Tet spells”
    - Clubbed fingers and toes with cyanosis

# Autonomic nervous system and nerves of the thorax
## Learning objectives
- Describe divisions of autonomic nervous system (ANS)
- Describe anatomical relationship of sympathetic chain to spinal nerves
- Describe sympathetic and parasympathetic (vagal) supply to heart
- Understand some clinical correlations associated with ANS

## Divisions of nervous system
- Central nervous system (CNS)
    - Brain, spinal cord (most nerve cell bodies, connections)
- Peripheral nervous system (PNS)
    - Link between CNS and peripheral structures (e.g. skin, receptors, muscles)
    - Cranial nerves, spinal nerves, and their branches
    - Autonomic nervous system

### Anatomy of spinal cord
- Dorsal horns: receive axons of sensory (afferent) neurons
- Ventral horns: send out axons of motor (efferent) neurons
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/NwLQnO0.png =250x)

#### Ganglion (pl. ganglia)
- A lump-like mass of nerve cell bodies (plus dendrites/synapses) associated with nerves of PNS
- Serve as relay stations
    - E.g. dorsal root ganglia (spinal ganglia) = cell bodies of sensory neurons
    - Autonomic ganglia = cell bodies of autonomic neurons
- ![](https://i0.wp.com/human-memory.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Dorsal-Root-Ganglion.png?resize=512%2C299 =250x)

#### Nerve plexuses
- Web-like interconnected fibers from many different nerves
    - E.g. spinal nerve plexuses: fibers from several spinal nerves come together
    - Autonomic plexuses (e.g. cardiac, oesophageal)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZQ7POFV.png =250x)

### Spinal nerves
- 31 pairs, all mixed nerves
- Named according to level of vertebral column from which they arise:
    - 8 pairs of cervical (C1-C8)
    - 12 pairs of thoracic (T1-T12)
    - 5 pairs of lumbar (L1-L5)
    - 5 pairs of sacral (S1-S5)
    - 1 pair of coccygeal (Co1)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/0P1Pgn0.png =150x)
- Arise from spinal cord by 2 roots:
    - Ventral (anterior) roots contain mainly motor (efferent) neurons
    - Dorsal (posterior) roots contain mainly sensory (afferent) neurons (and ganglia)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/CQNuNPa.png =250x)
- Spinal nerves bifurcate (divide into 2 branches) into rami
    - Dorsal (posterior) ramus
    - Ventral (anterior) ramus

## Peripheral nervous system (PNS)
- Functional components:
    - Sensory inputs and motor outputs
        - Categorised as somatic or visceral
            - Somatic: innervate skeletal (voluntary) muscles
            - Visceral (autonomic): innervate smooth and cardiac (involuntary) muscles and glands
            - ![](https://i.imgur.com/cLi0Svv.png =400x)
        - These can be further categorised as general or special
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/8eMEIMX.png =450x)

### Autonomic nervous system (ANS)
- Autonomic = “self governed”
- Involuntary effectors (smooth/cardiac muscles, glands)
- Divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic 
- Generally opposing effects
- ANS unique in that there are 2 neurons between spinal cord and target organ
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/GYWBPRH.png =450x)

#### Sympathetic nervous system
- Formed by neurons from spinal nerves T1-L2 (thoracolumbar outflow)
- Sympathetic neuron cell bodies located in lateral horn; neuron leaves via ventral root
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/3gOwLAr.png =250x)
- Sympathetic neurons branch from spinal nerves to form inter-connected ganglia (sympathetic chain)
- Pre- and post-ganglionic neurons can synapse here (paravertebral ganglia), or in distal ganglia (prevertebral)
- Post-ganglionic neuron continues to effector organ
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/mhOa3w1.png =350x)

##### Spinal nerves and sympathetic chain
- Pre-ganglionic sympathetic neurons pass into sympathetic chain via white ramus communicantes (myelinated)
- Will ascend or descend through chain (or pass through it to pre-vertebral ganglia) to synapse with post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons 
- Post-ganglionics return to spinal nerve via grey ramus communicantes to target blood vessels, sweat glands, erector pili associated with nerve
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/xtpDVlJ.png =275x)

##### Sympathetic innervation of heart
- Sympathetic neurons innervate heart at SA (primarily) and AV nodes
    - Sympathetic neurons act to increase heart rate and force of contraction
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/0pVL77C.png =350x)

##### Horner's syndrome
- Can result from damage to ipsilateral sympathetic trunk
- Associated with:
    - Miosis (constricted pupil)
    - Partial ptosis (weak, droopy eyelid)
    - Anhydrosis (decreased sweating)

#### Parasympathetic nervous system
- Formed by neurons in cranial nerves (III, VII, IX, X) and fibres in some sacral (S2-S4) nerves (craniosacral outflow)
- No chain ganglia
- Ganglia usually near or within the walls of the target organ
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/zWv5ogG.png =350x)
- Also known as “rest and digest” system
- Most active in non-stressful, non-emergency situations
- Tends to have calming effect on body: reduced energy expenditure, normal body maintenance
- No mass activation: organs individually activated

## Nerves
### Vagus nerve (CNX)
- Latin for “wandering”
- Emerges from medulla by rootlets lateral to olive
- Emerges from jugular foramen, descends in carotid sheath
- Ends close to left colic flexure of large intestine!
- Motor components:
    - SVE (branchial efferents): muscles of pharynx, larynx
    - N.B. in phonation and swallowing, coughing
    - GVE: smooth muscle, cardiac muscle (to slow heart rate), abdominal viscera
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/0Yu97aD.png =450x)

### Phrenic nerve
- Between parietal pleura and pericardium
- Somatic motor to diaphragm
- General sensory from:
    - Central diaphragm
    - Pleura
    - Pericardium
