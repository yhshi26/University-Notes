# L3: Coronary circulation
[Lecture 3 - Heart 3: Coronary circulation (Dr. Tom Flanagan)](https://brightspace.ucd.ie/d2l/le/content/155449/viewContent/1804124/View)
###### tags: `MDSA20180 - Cardiac Biology`

## Learning objectives
- Know origin, course and supply of coronary arteries
- Describe venous drainage of heart via cardiac veins and coronary sinus
- Be aware of certain clinical aspects of coronary arteries

## Coronary circulation: circulation to the heart itself

### Aortic valve
- Similar structure to pulmonary valve
- 3 semilunar cusps (left, right, posterior (non-coronary)), with free edges that coapt during valve closure
- Pocket-like sinus in wall of ascending aorta behind each cusp
- Note: right and left coronary arteries originate from left and right aortic sinuses respectively

### Coronary arteries (supply of heart)
![](https://i.imgur.com/UfX0uBh.png =350x)

#### Right coronary artery
- Arise from right aortic sinus of ascending aorta
- Descends along AV groove/coronary sulcus (between right atrium/ventricle)
    - Branch to SA node
    - Right (acute) marginal artery (RMA) (does not reach apex)
    - Posterior descending artery (PDA) (also called posterior interventricular branch)
    - Branch to AV node (at crux of heart)
- Right coronary artery supplies:
    - Right atrium
    - Most of right ventricle
    - Part of left ventricle (diaphragmatic surface)
    - Part of IV septum (usually posterior 1/3)
    - SA node (60%)
    - AV node (80%)

#### Interventricular septum
- Separates the left ventricle and the right ventricle
- Posterior 1/3 supply predominantly from right coronary artery
- Anterior 2/3 supply predominantly from left coronary artery
- Lateral section:

#### Left coronary artery
- "Left main stem" arises from left aortic sinus of ascending aorta
- Descends along coronary sulcus posteriorly to pulmonary trunk
- 2 main branches:
    - Anterior interventricular branch (LAD)
        - Courses along anterior IV groove
        - Can give rise to 1 or more lateral branches (diagonal arteries)
        - Courses around apex to anastomose with posterior interventricular artery
    - Circumflex (Cx) artery/branch
        - Follows coronary sulcus
        - Gives rise to left (obtuse) marginal branch (or several marginals)
        - Normally terminates before reaching crux
- Left coronary artery supplies:
    - Left atrium
    - Most of left ventricle
    - Part of right ventricle
    - Most of IV septum (usually anterior 2/3 inc. AV bundle)
    - [SA node (40%)]
    - [AV node (20%)]

#### Coronary dominance
- "Dominance" of the coronary arterial system defined by the giving rise to the posterior interventricular branch/supply
- Right dominance is common
    - RCA (70%)
    - RCA + LCA (20%; co-dominance)
    - LCA (10%)

### Coronary collateral circulation
- No major anastomoses between larger coronary essels
- Some collaterals exists among smaller branches, with potential for further development in cases of chronic arterial occlusion

### Coronary veins (drainage of heart)
- Coronary sinus is the major venous drainage vessel of the heart
- Situated in posterior coronary sulcus
- Great cardiac vein, posterior cardiac vein, middle cardiac vein and small cardiac vein (4 major tributaries of coronary sinus) drain into coronary sinus
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/j6wJN4r.png =250x)
- Coronary sinus drains to right atrium

## Clinical observations
### Coronary artery disease
- Leading cause of death worldwide
- Accumulation of atherosclerotic plaqies
- Reduced blood flow to heart muscle
- Sudden chest pain (typically radiating to left arm or left side of neck)
- Affected artery can be stented/by-passed with autologous or synthetic graft

### Strategies
#### Angioplasty
- Involves manually widening narrowed or obstructed arteries
- Balloon catheter placed in artery over guide wire using minimally invasive surgery (percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI)
- Expanded to compress plaque and withdrawn

- ![](https://i.imgur.com/UXxi48D.png =250x)

#### Stenting
- Follows same steps as balloon angioplasty
- Stent crimped onto balloon expands during deployment to keep lumen open
- Restenosis can occur however (foreign body response)

#### Bypass grafting
- Occlusion of >70% generally requires bypass grafting to revascularize affected area
- Generally open heart surgery (median sternotomy) required and cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung machine)
- ![](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/inline-images/cabg-1.jpg =250x)

### Most common sites of occlusion
- Anterior IV (LAD branch) of LCA (40-50%) ("widowmaker")
- RCA (30-40%)
- Circumflex branch of LCA (15-20%)
