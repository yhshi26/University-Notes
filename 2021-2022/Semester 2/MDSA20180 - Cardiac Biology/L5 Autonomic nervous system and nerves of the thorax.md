###### tags: `MDSA20180 - Cardiac Biology`

## Learning objectives
- Describe divisions of autonomic nervous system (ANS)
- Describe anatomical relationship of sympathetic chain to spinal nerves
- Describe sympathetic and parasympathetic (vagal) supply to heart
- Understand some clinical correlations associated with ANS

## Divisions of nervous system
- Central nervous system (CNS)
    - Brain, spinal cord (most nerve cell bodies, connections)
- Peripheral nervous system (PNS)
    - Link between CNS and peripheral structures (e.g. skin, receptors, muscles)
    - Cranial nerves, spinal nerves, and their branches
    - Autonomic nervous system

### Anatomy of spinal cord
- Dorsal horns: receive axons of sensory (afferent) neurons
- Ventral horns: send out axons of motor (efferent) neurons

#### Ganglion (pl. ganglia)
- A lump-like mass of nerve cell bodies (plus dendrites/synapses) associated with nerves of PNS
- Serve as relay stations
    - E.g. dorsal root ganglia (spinal ganglia) = cell bodies of sensory neurons
    - Autonomic ganglia = cell bodies of autonomic neurons

#### Nerve plexuses
- Web-like interconnected fibers from many different nerves
    - E.g. spinal nerve plexuses: fibers from several spinal nerves come together
    - Autonomic plexuses (e.g. cardiac, oesophageal)

### Spinal nerves
- 31 pairs, all mixed nerves
- Named according to level of vertebral column from which they arise:
    - 8 pairs of cervical (C1-C8)
    - 12 pairs of thoracic (T1-T12)
    - 5 pairs of lumbar (L1-L5)
    - 5 pairs of sacral (S1-S5)
    - 1 pair of coccygeal (Co1)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/0P1Pgn0.png =150x)
- Arise from spinal cord by 2 roots:
    - Ventral (anterior) roots contain mainly motor (efferent) neurons
    - Dorsal (posterior) roots contain mainly sensory (afferent) neurons (and ganglia)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/CQNuNPa.png =250x)
- Spinal nerves bifurcate (divide into 2 branches) into rami
    - Dorsal (posterior) ramus
    - Ventral (anterior) ramus

## Peripheral nervous system (PNS)
- Functional components:
    - Sensory inputs and motor outputs
        - Categorised as somatic or visceral
            - Somatic: innervate skeletal (voluntary) muscles
            - Visceral (autonomic): innervate smooth and cardiac (involuntary) muscles and glands
            - ![](https://i.imgur.com/cLi0Svv.png =400x)
        - These can be further categorised as general or special
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/8eMEIMX.png =450x)

### Autonomic nervous system (ANS)
- Autonomic = “self governed”
- Involuntary effectors (smooth/cardiac muscles, glands)
- Divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic 
- Generally opposing effects
- ANS unique in that there are 2 neurons between spinal cord and target organ
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/GYWBPRH.png =450x)

#### Sympathetic nervous system
- Formed by neurons from spinal nerves T1-L2 (thoracolumbar outflow)
- Sympathetic neuron cell bodies located in lateral horn; neuron leaves via ventral root
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/3gOwLAr.png =250x)
- Sympathetic neurons branch from spinal nerves to form inter-connected ganglia (sympathetic chain)
- Pre- and post-ganglionic neurons can synapse here (paravertebral ganglia), or in distal ganglia (prevertebral)
- Post-ganglionic neuron continues to effector organ
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/mhOa3w1.png =350x)

##### Spinal nerves and sympathetic chain
- Pre-ganglionic sympathetic neurons pass into sympathetic chain via white ramus communicantes (myelinated)
- Will ascend or descend through chain (or pass through it to pre-vertebral ganglia) to synapse with post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons 
- Post-ganglionics return to spinal nerve via grey ramus communicantes to target blood vessels, sweat glands, erector pili associated with nerve
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/xtpDVlJ.png =275x)

##### Sympathetic innervation of heart
- Sympathetic neurons innervate heart at SA (primarily) and AV nodes
    - Sympathetic neurons act to increase heart rate and force of contraction
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/0pVL77C.png =350x)

##### Horner's syndrome
- Can result from damage to ipsilateral sympathetic trunk
- Associated with:
    - Miosis (constricted pupil)
    - Partial ptosis (weak, droopy eyelid)
    - Anhydrosis (decreased sweating)

#### Parasympathetic nervous system
- Formed by neurons in cranial nerves (III, VII, IX, X) and fibres in some sacral (S2-S4) nerves (craniosacral outflow)
- No chain ganglia
- Ganglia usually near or within the walls of the target organ
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/zWv5ogG.png =350x)
- Also known as “rest and digest” system
- Most active in non-stressful, non-emergency situations
- Tends to have calming effect on body: reduced energy expenditure, normal body maintenance
- No mass activation: organs individually activated

## Nerves
### Vagus nerve (CNX)
- Latin for “wandering”
- Emerges from medulla by rootlets lateral to olive
- Emerges from jugular foramen, descends in carotid sheath
- Ends close to left colic flexure of large intestine!
- Motor components:
    - SVE (branchial efferents): muscles of pharynx, larynx
    - N.B. in phonation and swallowing, coughing
    - GVE: smooth muscle, cardiac muscle (to slow heart rate), abdominal viscera
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/0Yu97aD.png =450x)

### Phrenic nerve
- Between parietal pleura and pericardium
- Somatic motor to diaphragm
- General sensory from:
    - Central diaphragm
    - Pleura
    - Pericardium
