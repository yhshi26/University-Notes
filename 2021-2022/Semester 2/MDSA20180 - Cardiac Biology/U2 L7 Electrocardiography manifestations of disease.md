## Abnormal heart rates
- “Sinus rhythm” = normal heart rhythm 
- Clinically, dysrhythmias are classified by:
    - Rate (↑ or ↓) 
        - Abnormal heart rates:
            - Tachycardia: fast
            - Bradycardia: slow
    - Or site of origin of abnormality:
        - Atrial, junctional or ventricular

## Irregular ECG
- Irregularly irregular: irregularly irregular rhythm has no pattern
    - Atrial fibrillation (AF): no discernible P waves and QRS complexes are irregularly irregular
    - Ventricular fibrillation (VF): irregular electrical signals in ventricles
- Regularly irregular: different rates multiples of each other
    - Mobitz type II AV block ratio of AV conduction varies from 2:1 to 3:1
    - Atrial flutter has a ‘sawtooth’ baseline of atrial depolarization (~300/min) and regular QRS

### Heart blocks
![](https://i.imgur.com/2GISAa5.png =350x)
- 1 degree heart block: prolonged PR interval (>200 ms) (delayed AV signal)
- 2 degree heart block: skipped QRS complexes (non-conducted signals) with (Mobitz 1) or  without (Mobitz 2) PR delay
    - Mobitz type 1 block has gradual prolongation of PR intervals before a block occurs
    - Mobitz type 2 block has constant PR intervals before blocks occur
- 3 degree heart block: no link between P waves and QRS complexes, atria and ventricles contact independently
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/yJuTnhY.png =350x)
- Bundle branch block: block of conduction through one of main ventricular bundles leads to delayed and aberrant excitation of ventricles resulting in a broadened QRS complex (left or right bundle branch block, LBBB or RBBB); BBBs have QRS > 0.12s
    - An altered ventricular excitation is followed by an altered sequence of repolarization leading to changes in appearance of T wave such as inverted T wave

### Tachyarrythmias

#### Atrial fibrillation

#### Atrial flutter
![](https://i.imgur.com/T5w6pM2.png =350x)

#### Ventricular fibrillation
- VF is a life-threatening heart rhythm in which ventricles of heart do not contract efficiently due to disorganized electrical activity
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZwOAD82.png =350x)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/DkrXIoy.png =350x)

#### Torsades de pointes
- Torsade de pointes is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia characterized by a gradual change in amplitude and twisting of QRS complexes around isoelectric line
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/a1QysE9.png =350x)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/bdJE1qL.png =350x)

#### Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
- ECG characteristics of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome: 
    - Delta wave broadens ventricular complex and shortens PR interval (< 120ms)
    - T-wave could be also reversed
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/hRBKoXL.png =350x)

### Premature atrial complexes (PAC)
- Spontaneous premature depolarization originating in atria
- Spreads to ventricle via cardiac conduction system
- Resulting QRS complex is not altered
- P wave may be inverted (depending on exact APC origin)
- Pause APC is usually less than fully compensatory (non-compensatory) because sinoatrial node is depolarized and reset by APC, and depolarization has to start again in sinoatrial node resulting in a shift in sinus rythm (N)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/HpPA9FW.png =450x)

### Ventricular premature complex (VPC)
- Spontaneous premature depolarization originating in ventricles (not preceded by a P wave)
- Does not spread via ventricular conduction system
- Thus, axis of depolarization is different, QRS complex appears broad and T wave is abnormal
- VPCs are usually followed by a fully compensatory pause since SA node is not depolarized
- Normal sinus rhythm (N) is not altered

### Ischaemic heart disease (IHD)
- During ST-phase of ECG (depolarized ventricle) potential differences between healthy (depolarized) and ischaemic (less or not depolarized) tissue are superimposed onto normal ECG waves
- Subendocardial ischaemia: ST-segment depression (potential difference pointing away from measuring electrode)
- Transmural ischaemia: ST-segment elevation (potential difference pointing towards measuring electrode)

#### ECG and coronary territories
- Appearance of ischemia patterns in certain ECG leads provides some information on anatomic localization of ischemia

|  | ECG changes | Coronary artery |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Anteroseptal | V1-V4 | Left anterior descending |
| Inferior | II, III, aVF | Right coronary |
| Anterolateral | V4-V6, I, aVL | Left anterior descending or left circumflex |
| Lateral | I, aVL +/- V5-6 | Left circumflex |
| Posterior | Tall R waves V1-2 | Usually left circumflex and right coronary |

### Ventricular hypertrophy
- If sum of S wave in V1 or V2 plus R wave in V5 or V6 is > than 35 mm (≥ 7 large squares), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is present
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/8eW3uNU.png =350x)

### Acute coronary syndrome
- ACS is a sudden, reduced blood flow to heart
- Myocardial ischemia occurs when blood flow to heart muscle (myocardium) is obstructed by a partial or complete blockage of a coronary artery by a build-up of plaques (atherosclerosis)
- If plaques rupture, you can have a heart attack: myocardial infarction

#### Myocardial infarction (MI)
- Within hours, T wave may become peaked and ST segments may begin to rise
- Within 24h, T wave inverts, as ST segment elevation begins to resolve
    - ST elevation rarely persists, unless a left ventricular aneurysm develops
    - T wave inversion may or may not persist
- Within hours or days, pathological Q waves begin to form
- Acute anterior myocardial infarction -> ST segment elevation and evolving Q waves in leads V1–V4 (also named C1–C4)

##### Types of MI
- Partial occlusion of coronary arteries can lead to myocardial infarction withoutST-segment elevation: "Non-STEMI"
- Fully occluding thrombosis leads to myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation: "STEMI"

### Angina pectoris
- Reversible ST-segment depression during tachycardia
- Might be associated with pain (exercise-induced angina) → subendocardial ischaemia
