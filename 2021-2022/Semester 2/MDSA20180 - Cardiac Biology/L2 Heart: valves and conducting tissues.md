## Learning objectives
- Describe anatomy and fucntion of valves of haert
- Understand structure and function of fibrous skeleton of heart
- Describe and understand cardiac conduction system

## Heart valves
- 2 valves to allow blood to pass from atria to respective ventricles = atrioventricular valve
    - Mitral and tricuspid valve 
        - Mitral valve: between left atrium and left ventricle 
        - Tricuspid valve: between right atrium and right ventricle 
    - 2 semilunar valves that allow blood to pass from ventricles to: 1. lungs, 2. rest of body 
        1. Pulmonary valve: between right ventricle and pulmonary artery 
        2. Aortic valve: between left ventricle and aorta

### Aortic valve
- Ventricular contraction = valve open
- Semilunar valve
    - The other is pulmonary valve 
- 3 half moon shaped cusps 
    - Open silently, closure of valves is reason for heart sounds 
- Allows blood flow into aorta during ventricular contraction , prevents blood flow moving back in the opposite direction during ventricular relaxation 
    - Cusps are forced to close with recoil of blood from aorta after ventricle contracts filling the sinuses of the cusps 
        - Think of a dropper when you squeeze it first it expels liquid but when you let it relax it pulls liquid back in 
- Sometimes can be bicuspid 
- Calcification: valve starts to accumulate calcific deposits called aortic stenosis 
    - Thought to be genetic
    - Narrowing of the aortic valve opening restricting blood flow from the left ventricle tothe aorta

### Atrioventricular valves
- Ventricular contraction = valve closed 
- In general the design is the cups with tendons connecting to the papillary muscles 
    - Tendons to ensure that when the valves contracts that it closes properly 
- When ventricles are filling the valves are open 
    - Contraction of papillary muscles attached to cusps by chordae tendinae keeps valves closed during ventricular contraction and ensures the blood doesn’t push the cusps up and fill the atria 
- Opening and closing of these valves is passive: based on pressure 
    - When blood pressure in atrium is greater than in ventricle the valve is pushed open and blood flows from atrium → ventricle 
    - When ventricle is contracting and creates a stronger internal pressure it forces the valve closed 
- Right ventricle = tricuspid valve 
    - Anterior, inferior and septal cusps  
- Left ventricle = bicuspid = mitral valve 
    - Anteromedial cusp and posterolateral cusp

    - On this diagram you can also see anterior and posterior grooves 
        - Anterior and posterior interventricular sulcus
            - Groove separates ventricles of the heart
        - Coronary sulcus (not seen on this) 
            - Atria separated from ventricles by coronary sulcus 
    - More inferior into the RV you can see the moderator band  
        - Carries important impulse through side wall of RV

### Right atrioventricular valve = tricuspid valve
- Cusps of the right atrioventricular valve (tricuspid valve) attach to chordae tendinae
- Chordae tendinae extend to papillary muscles 
    - Chordae tendinae from 2 paillary muscle attach to each cusp preventing separation of cusps during ventricular contraction
- The inferior papillary muscle, anterior muscle and septal muscle

### Left atrioventricular valve = mitral valve
- Cusps are continuous with each other near their bases at sites called commissures in atrioventricular valves
- Myocardial infarction = lack of blood supply causing tissue damage 
    - When near the mitral valve can cause ripping of the papillary muscles 
        - Usually seen as a systolic murmur

### Surface anatomy for cardiac valves
- Aortic valve sends pulse to 3rd intercostal space 
    - Right ventricle relaxing
- Pulmonary valve pulse at other side of the sternum at 3rd intercostal space 
    - Left ventricle relaxing 
- Mitral valve sends pulse to apex of heart 
    - Left ventricle contracting
- Tricuspid valve sends pulse to 
    - Right ventricle contracting

## Auscultations
### Positioning stethoscope to ascultate valves

### Heart sounds
- M1T1 ---- A2P2 
    - Lub ---- Dub
    - Mitral1,Tricuspid1 --- Aortic1,Pulmonary1 
- Valves of left heart close first by a very small amount
    - Left heart is activated first 
    - Bigger and conducting tissue is bigger 
- Normal heartbeat = simple lub dub

#### Heart murmurs
- Aortic stenosis
- Didn't finish

## Fibrous skeleton
- Dense connective tissue 
- Electrical insulator
    - Insulates atria from ventricles 
- Structure and support 
    - Scaffolding present for cusps of valves 
- In cardiac cells they’re connected through gap junctions 
- Reason for pause between atria and ventricles contracting is that they are electrically insulated due to fibrous skeleton

## Conducting system
- Made of cardiac cells that have specialised features for heart excitation 
    - Network of cells = conducting system 
    - In electrical contact with cardiac muscle cells via gap junctions
- Initiates heartbeat and helps spread rapid impulse throughout the heart 
- Contraction of cardiac muscle is triggered by depolarisation of the plasma membrane
    - Initial excitation of 1 cell spreads rapidly due to gap junctions 
        - Gap junctions allow action potentials to jump from 1 cell to another 
- Initial depolarisation arises in a small group of conducting system cells: Sinoatrial (SA) node 
    - SA node = pacemaker of the heart 
    - Located in right atrium near entrance to SVC 
    - AP generated here spreads throughout the atria then into and throughout the ventricles 
    - SA node discharge rate determines the heart rate 
        - Heart rate = number of times heart contracts per minute 
- Spread of depolarisation is rapid enough that the two atria contract at the same time
- Spread of the action potential to the ventricles is more complicated 
- Link between atrial and ventricular conducting system = Atrioventricular (AV) node
    - Located at base of RA at Koch’s c
        - Koch’s Triangle = anatomical area of which its angles are
            1. Coronary sinus orifice 2. Tendon of Todaro 3. AV node -spreading of AP through RA causes depolarisation of the AV node -this node as a very important characteristic: the propagation of APs through the AV node is relatively slow
        - Delay allows atrial contraction to be completed before ventricular excitation occurs 
- After leaving AV node AP propagates down interventricular (IV) septum 
    - This pathway of conducting fibres = Bundle of His
    - AV node + Bundle of His = only connection of conducting system between atria and ventricles
- Bundle of His branches into right and left bundle branches in IV septum 
    - At apex of heart these branches enter walls of left and right ventricles 
    - Fibres make contact with purkinje fibres 
        - Large conducting cells 
        - Rapidly distribute impulse through much of the ventricles 
    - Purkinje fibres make contact with ventricular myocardial cells which spread the impulse through rest of ventricles 
- Rapid conduction along fibres cause depolarisation to happen nearly simultaneously → single coordinated contraction 
    - Apex contracts slightly earlier causing the blood to move upwards towards the valve for an efficient contraction
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/cJJmQv1.png =300x)
- Moderator band (also called septomarginal band) = muscular band that carries part of right bundle branch to the anterior papillary muscle 
    - Extends from inferior septum

### Cardiac action potentials
- Mechanism by which APs are conducted in membranes of heart cells is similar to other excitable tissues 
- Different types of heart cells express unique combinations of ion channels that produce different AP shapes 
    - Allows for specialisation of different roles in the spread of excitation through heart 
- Cardiac action potential takes a different form in different cardiac cells 
    - SA nodal cells, atrial muscle cells, AV nodal cells, Purkinje fibres, ventricular muscle cells 
- Cardiac ventricular AP shape shows rapid depolarisation and repolarisation 
    - Rapid upstroke (phase 0) caused by rapid opening of Na+ channels → depolarisation 
    - Followed by partial repolarisation (phase 1) caused by closing of the fast channels opening K^+^ channel
    - Membrane potential enters plateau phase (phase 2) due to inward Ca^2+^ currents 
    - Repolarisation phase (phase 3) occurs as Ca^2+^ channels inactivate and more K^+^ channels open and Na^+^ channels revert to closed state
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/kcmV6zH.png =350x)
- SA node = most excitable cells in the heart 
    - Has an unstable resting potential so instead undergoes a slow depolarisation 
        - Gradual depolarisation = pacemaker potential 
    - 3 mechanisms contribute to pacemaker potential:
        1. Progressive reduction in K^+^ permeability: K^+^ channels gradually close due to membrane’s return to negative potentials 
        2. Unique set of pacemaker channels called “funny” or F-type channels: open when the membrane potential is at negative values conducting a depolarising Na^+^ current
        3. T-type Ca^2+^ channels: Ca^2+^ channel that opens briefly but contributes to Ca^2+^ current and an important final depolarising boost to pacemaker potential
