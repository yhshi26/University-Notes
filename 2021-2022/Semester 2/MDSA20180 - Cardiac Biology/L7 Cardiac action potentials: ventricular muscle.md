## Cardiac action potential
- Cardiac muscle contraction is triggered by an action potential at the plasma membrane (sarcolemma) 
- Electrical excitation originates in the sinoatrial node and spreads through atria and ventricles
- Rapid conduction of the electrical signal, i.e. an action potential, effects a coordinated contractile response

## Membrane potential
- Plasma membranes of cells separate electrical charge
- Thus, a membrane potential (V~m~) can exist 
- At rest the potential is the resting membrane potential and the inside of the plasma membrane is negative (-) with respect to the outside

### Generation of membrane potential
- An uneven distribution of ions across the plasma membrane sets up the membrane potential
- Distribution is determined by functions of ion pumps, ion exchangers and ion channels

#### Figure 1: membrane potential generation
- Pink  structure  represents  sarcolemma 
- Gray  cylindrical  structures represent ion channels
- Ions we are concerned with here are Ca^2+^, K^+^, and NA^+^, although  we  should  not  forget  that  other  ions  contribute too such as Cl^-^
- At rest:
    - [Na^+^] is 140mM outside and 10mM inside
    - [K^+^] is 4mM outside and 140mM inside
    - [Ca^2+^] is  1.2mM outside and  0.1  micromolar  (or  100nM) inside
- If channels are opened, ions flow down their concentration gradients, i.e. Na^+^ in, K^+^ out and Ca^2+^ in 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/vUrsomp.png =250x)
- How differences in concentrations arise:
    - Na^+^ pump uses ATP as an energy source to drive Na^+^ out and K^+^ in and is therefore known as the Na^+^/K^+^ ATPase
    - It has a negative effect on V~m~ which is further enhanced by K^+^ leaking back out
    - Ca^2+^ is pumped out by Ca^2+^ pump mechanism which  also uses ATP for its function
    - Said pumps require ATP because Na^+^, K^+^ and Ca^2+^ ions are moved against their concentration gradients
    - Na^+^ concentration gradient can be harnessed to drive Ca^2+^ out against Ca^2+^ concentration and electrical gradients using Na^+^/Ca^2+^ exchanger 

#### Figure 2: resting membrane potential
- At rest we have Na^+^ and Ca^2+^ channels mainly in a  closed state while K^+^ leaks out through channels called inward rectifier K^+^ channels (we don't need to be concerned by what is meant by  rectification for  this lecture)
- Flow of K^+^ out through these channels generates a  current called i~Kir~ where i denotes an electrical current 
    - It's also known in some parts of literature as i~K1~
- K^+^ leaking out down its concentration gradient leaves a net negative charge on inside of cell so membrane potential is about -80mV
- There is also a small Na^+^ leak back into cell but V~m~ is mostly generated by K^+^ efflux

#### Figure 3: ventricular muscle (fast response) action potential
- Figure shows time course of AP in a ventricular cardiac  muscle cell
- There is a resting V~m~ of about -80 to -85mV then a rapid upstroke as V~m~ approaches 0mV
    - Trigger for this event is an AP arriving from a neighbouring cell
- We then observe an overshoot as V~m~ becomes positive for a period
- We then note a prolonged plateau phase rather than an  immediate  repolarisation
    - This  phase  is  functionally  very  important  
- Next phase is repolarisation before whole process begins again
    - This AP is also known as a fast response action potential owing to this rapid upstroke phase
- Rapid upstroke phase is caused by a rapid influx of Na^+^ ions
- Plateau phase is caused by an influx of Ca^2+^ ions and  then repolarisation occurs as a result of K^+^ efflux
- Notice how AP lasts for about 250-300 msec which is  considerably longer than that observed in skeletal muscle

#### Figure 4: cardiac muscle refractory period
- Ventricular cardiac muscle cells have a prolonged  action potential and while membrane  remains  depolarised,  no  further action potential can be generated
    - If an action potential is not possible then muscle is electrically inexcitable and no contraction can be stimulated
    - Period of time in which no AP can be generated is called  refractory period
- Most tension generated by an AP is lost before end of AP and muscle will usually be relaxed before next AP is  generated
- This arrangement avoids summation of contractions, i.e. no tetanic contraction can occur in contrast to case of skeletal muscle
    - This is functionally important because it means muscle relaxes fully which permits filling of ventricles between  contractions
- AP and contraction share a similar time course, therefore a long plateau phase means a long refractory period which in turn means a long time between successive contractions

## Ventricular action potential 5 phases (0-4)
- Action potential observed in ventricular myocytes is said to have five phases, 0-4. 
    0. Rapid upstroke 
    1. Early repolarisation 
    2. Plateau 
    3. Repolarisation 
    4. Resting potential 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/CQyjFRT.png =250x)

### Figure 1: phase 0
- Resting V~m~ is about -80 to -85mV
- An AP arrives from a neighbouring myocyte or cardiac conduction system which drives the V~m~ in a positive direction and when V~m~ reaches about -60 to -65mV Na^+^ channels called fast Na^+^ channels open, so Na^+^ enters making V~m~ rapidly more positive (phase 0), rising to about +20mV
    - This is called the overshoot
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/IXALKvn.png =250x)

#### Figure 1.1: fast Na^+^ channels
- Fast Na^+^ channels activate and inactive rapidly and we  can consider them to be both voltage-dependent and time-dependent 
- At rest, fast sodium channels are closed
- They possess an inactivation gate normally represented  by  a ball and chain arrangement that blocks pore through which  Na^+^ can pass
- Following opening, they rapidly become inactivated by gate
- Closure occurs as repolarisation progresses and inactivation gate no longer blocks pore
- Importantly, no AP is possible while channels are in inactive state and this accounts for refractory period 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/kGSrQPL.png =250x)

#### Figure 2: phase 1
- Phase 1 is a brief repolarisation phase accounted for by  a transient outward current i~to~ carried by K^+^ moving through voltage gated K^+^ channels (they are opened by the depolarisation of phase 0 but then become inactivated in a  rapid way)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/EYPgaym.png =250x)

#### Figure 3: phase 2
- Phase 2 is a plateau period
- As described above, there is an inward flow of Ca^2+^, i.e. an i~Ca^2+^~, through voltage dependent Ca^2+^  channels
- Simultaneously, a reduced K^+^ efflux (i~Kir~) occurs and  a situation arises where electrical effect of i~Ca2+~ almost  counterbalances effect of diminished K~+~ efflux and this  accounts for plateau effect
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/2jhCv9d.png =250x)

#### Figure 4: phase 3
- Phase 3 is a repolarisation phase associated with an  increased K^+^ permeability
- This increase occurs as a result of opening of voltage  dependent K^+^ channels (K~v~ channels) in response to depolarisation
- K~v~ channels opened slowly hence they are known as  delayed rectifier K~+~ channels or slow K^+^ channels (i.e. K~s~ channels)
- Repolarisation causes K~ir~ to reopen which encourages more K^+^ efflux and thus more repolarisation
- When resting V~m~ is reached, K~v~ channels (or K~s~ channels) close, leaving K~ir~ as main channels keeping V~m~ so negative
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/f8mpxzB.png =250x)

#### Figure 5: phase 4
- In phase 4, resting V~m~ has been re-established and most  of extra Ca^2+^ ions in cytosol arising from AP are pumped into the SR store
    - Some are extruded from cell by Ca^2+^ pumps and  some  by  Na^+^/Ca^2+^  exchangers
- In addition to K^+^ efflux through K~ir~ there is also a current called inward background current i~b~ which is  mainly accounted for by Na^+^ leaking back into cell which  results in resting V~m~ being not as negative as it might otherwise have been (i.e.  about  -90mV)
- K~v~ channels remain closed until next AP arises

## Summary
- Resting membrane potential is established mainly by K^+^ efflux and a small background Na^+^ influx
- Magnitude, direction and timing of Na^+^, K^+^ and Ca^2+^ currents determine form of action potential
- Upstroke of action potential (plateau phase) and repolarisation phases are dominated by Na^+^, Ca^2+^ and K^+^ currents, respectively
- Prolonged action potential provides for an extended refractory period which avoids tetanic contractions

### Clinical consideration: arrhythmia
- Action potential duration changes in pathological conditions 
    - Hypoxia shortens the duration as a consequence of K~ATP~ opening
    - Certain mutations lead to channel protein variants that lengthen plateau duration
        - e.g. mutation in delayed rectifier protein gene KCNQ1 or Na^+^ channel gene SCN5A cause long QT syndrome which can lead to fainting or sudden cardiac death

## Additional notes
- Action potential duration is influenced by autonomic nerves
    - Sympathetic stimulation shortens duration as a consequence of stimulation of repolarising current through K~V~ (K~S~): repolarisation occurs sooner
    - Shorter duration allows more action potentials per minute
