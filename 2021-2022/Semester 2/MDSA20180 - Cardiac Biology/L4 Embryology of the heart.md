###### tags: `MDSA20180 - Cardiac Biology`

## Learning objectives
- Know details of development of heart, including that of its inflow and outflow tract, valves, septae and chambers
- Understand the basic mechanism of folding and rotation fo heart during development
- Understand disorders of heart and embryogenesis

## Cardiac embryogenesis
- Cardiovascular system develops from splanchnic layer of lateral mesoderm 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/kmIbCXR.png =250x)
- Cardiovascular system = first major system to function in embryo
    - Necessary as rapidly growing embryo can no longer rely on diffusion for nutrients/oxygen
    - Primordial heart and vascular system appear in middle of 3rd week
    - Heart begins to beat at 22-23 days

### Cardiogenic field
- Cardiogenic region can be thought of as bilateral regions of primary heart cells that merge cranially to form horseshoe-shaped field 
    - Horseshoe-shaped field = primary crescent
- Cardiac progenitor cells migrate towards cranial end of embryo (beyond oropharyngeal membrane)
- Reside in splanchnic layer of lateral plate mesoderm
- Induced by endoderm to form paired angioblastic cords
- Canalise (hollow out) to form endocardial tubes (heart tubes)
- Blood islands appear in mesoderm (will form blood cells and vessels) e.g. 2 dorsal aortae

### Sequence of events 
- Occurs towards end of the 3rd week
- Day 18: cardiac precursor cells seen in form of blood islands 
- Day 20: first intraembryonic blood vessels seen 
- Day 21: folding, heart tube formation and looping 
- Day 22: heart starts to beat, ebb and flow initially
    - Heart beat not a true pulsatile type pattern and blood flow is more an “ebb and flow” pattern 
    - Ebb and flow pattern is when the flow slows down and speeds up 
- Day 28: embryonic circulation established 
- Week 8: fully functional, multi-chambered heart

## Blood formation
- Blood cells differentiate in mesoderm of yolk sac as blood islands 
- These islands are surrounded with endothelial sacs 
- Sacs then interconnect 
- Heart begins to beat and blood is driven through the meshwork 
- Where blood flow is fastest, blood vessels begin to form
- Blood formation then shifts to: 
    - The aorta 
    - Gonad 
    - Mesonephric region 
- Location of blood formation followed by the liver and spleen 
- Finally moves to bone marrow 
- Different haemoglobin types are necessary for the embryo, fetus and adult 

## Head fold
- With formation of the head fold (due to rapid growth of brain) the cardiogenic area changes position to within this longitudinal fold 
- Embryo folds longitudinally, heart and pericardial cavity move to cervical region and finally to thorax
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/kTOi5xI.png =200x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/zBlGtkl.png =200x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/lApIoXn.png =200x)
- Transverse folding of the embryo brings heart tubes into ventral midline allowing them to fuse to form single primordial heart tube (day 22)
    - Caudal regions of paired cardiac primordia (endocardial tubes) merge in midline to form single heart tube
    - Initially suspended from developing foreget by dorsal mesocardium
    - Transverse folding also forms pericardial cavity surrounding fusing heart tubes
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/e2SYRN4.png =350x)

### Heart tube
- After fusion, dilations appear in heart tube forming divisions (5):
    1. Trunchus arteriosus → pulmonary trunk & ascending aorta
    2. Bulbus cordis → right ventricle, right and left outflow tracts
    3. Primordial ventricle → left ventricle
    4. Primordial atrium → left and right atria
    5. Sinus venosus (left and right) horns → part of right atrium, left and right auricles, coronary sinus
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/fdCLPge.png =200x)
- Heart is able to push blood cranially from the sinus venosus 
- Atria and ventricles are not separated

#### Heart tube folding and rotation
- Allows straight heart tube to form more complex structure
- Most folding and rotation occurs in week 4, completes in week 5
- Summarised steps of folding and rotation: 
    1. Straight heart tube begins to elongate with simultaneous growth in the bulbus cordisand primitive ventricle 
    2. Causes heart to bend ventrally and rotate to the right forming a C-shaped loop with convex side situated on the right 
    3. Ventricular bend moves caudally (towards bottoms) and the distance between outflow and inflow tracts diminishes 
    4. The atrial and outflow poles converge and myocardial cells are added, forming the truncus arteriosus and forming S-shape
        - Atria moves to lie behind ventricles (S-shaped loop)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/XP2HuGl.png =450x)

##### Clinical anomaly: dextrocardia
- Normal (A): folding occurs ventricals ventrally and to the right, atriums dorsally and to the left
- Dextrocardia (B): folding occurs ventricals dorsally and to the left, atriums ventrally and to the right (backwards)

## Endocardial cushions
- Subset of cells in the development of heart with vital role in formation of the heart septa 
- Form initial division of right and left atria and ventricles
    - Dorsal (posterior) and ventral (anterior) surfaces of AV canal 
- Mesenchymal cells from endocardium invade cushions allowing them to grow and fuse 
- Grow into canal
    - Meet and fuse to separate AV canal into R/L channels

### Ventricular septation
- Appearance of primordial muscular interventricular ridge
    - Develops in floor of ventricle near the apex 
- As either side of the ventricle grows and dilates the medial walls fuse forming the prominent IV septum 
- IV foramen = opening between cranial portion of IV septum and the endocardial cushions 
    - Closes by end of 7th week 
- 2 components
    - Superior membranes 
    - Inferior muscular

### Atrial septation
- AV junction
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/ePQ3RDP.png =350x)
- Septum primum begins to form from membranous tissue at the roof of the atrium 
    - Divides into R/L atria
    - Blood can still pass between
- Space between septum primum and endocardial cushions = foramen primum
- Perforations in septum primum due to apoptosis 
    - Produce the foramen secundum 
- Septum secundum forms immediately to the right of septum primum
    - Gradually overlaps the foramen secundum during 5/6 weeks
- Incomplete partition of the atrium by the septum secundum = foramen ovale
    - 2 membranes aren’t touching (septum primum and secondum)
    - Blood can flow through foramen ovale and out through foramen secundum into LA
        - Forms a right → left shunt 
        - Remaining portion of septum primum acts as a valve preventing backflow 
- Blood pressure in heart increases after birth
    - 2 membranes fuse together
    - Blood cannot flow from right to left anymore

## Clinical implications
- 80/10,000 live births have a heart abnormality
- ~40% liveborn babies with congenital anomalies
- How common are they? Of congenital heart defects
    - 4% single gene mutations
    - 6% chromosomal abnormalities
    - 5% exposure to teratogens
    - Remaining are unknown, multifactorial causes
- Different types: add up to more than 100% as more than one can be present at any one time
    - Ventricular septal defect (25-50%)
    - Atrial septal defect (10%) 
    - Tetralogy of fallot (10%) 
    - Patent ductus arteriosus (25%)
    - Coarctation of the aorta (10%) 

### Foetal circulation before birth
- FO allows blood to cross to LA, bypasses lungs
    - Not used in womb, don’t need blood supply
- Ductus arteriosus also cuts out lungs
- Normally both close after birth

### Foetal circulation after birth
- End of blood flow through umbilical circulation
    - Uses own circulation system 
- Lungs drain, circulatory bed expands
- Ductus arteriosus ceases to carry blood, diminishes, slowly closes
- FO closes

### Ventricular septal defects
- Can involve membranous (more serious) or muscular part (can resolve as child grows)
- Blood crosses heart initially L – R
- Similar to ASDs, can overburden right heart and lungs leading to:
    - Pulmonary hypertension
    - Right heart failure 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/4Z0tRPd.png =250x)

### Atrial septal defect
- May be associated with trisomy 21
- If minor (small), can be asymptomatic (doesn't cause problems)
- If major (large), can cause extra blood to overfill the lungs and pulmonary hypertension, increasing workload on right heart
- May be closed by catheterisation

### Tetralogy of fallot
- Unequal division of outflow tract, displacement of conotruncal septum
    - Narrow right ventricular outflow region (pulmonary stenosis)
    - Ventricular septal defect (VSD)
    - Overriding (misplaced) aorta (lies over VSD)
    - Right ventricular hypertrophy
- Symptoms:
    - Oxygen-poor blood flows to body (cyanosis, shortness of breath)
    - Respiratory distress (dyspnea), with rapid breathing
    - Characteristic squatting posture, at rest, to relieve dyspnea (increases blood flow to lungs)
    - Coeur en sabot (boot-shaped heart) in x-ray
    - Cyanosis develops gradually, with intermittent severe “Tet spells”
    - Clubbed fingers and toes with cyanosis
