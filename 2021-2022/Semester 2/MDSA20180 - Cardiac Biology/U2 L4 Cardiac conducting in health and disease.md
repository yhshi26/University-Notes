## Cardiac physiology overview
- Heart is a hollow, muscular organ whose function is to pump blood and nutrients it carries around body
- Rhythmic contraction and relaxation generates heart pumping action
    - Contraction pushes blood out of heart into vasculature (systole)
    - Relaxation allows heart to fill with blood (diastole)
- Wave of contraction (induced by an action potential) spreads through cardiac muscle:
    - Both atria contract as a unit
    - Both ventricles contract as a unit
    - Atrial contraction precedes ventricular

## Cellular elements of conduction system
- Conduction system consists of:
    - Pacemaker cells: coordinate and provide rhythm to heartbeat; sinoatrial (SA) node is pacemaker of heart
    - Conduction fibres: rapidly conduct action potentials initiated by pacemaker cells to myocardium
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/GN5W7nL.png =350x)

### Conducting and contractile cells 
- Heart contains a specialized conduction system that directs and facilitates spreading of original action potential from sinoatrial (SA) node to entire heart
- 2 cell types are required: 
    1. Pacemaker cells: regulate rate and rhythmic beating of heart
    2. Cardiac myocytes: contractile force of atria and ventricles
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/05ReJrn.png =250x)

#### Sinoatrial (SA) node
- 1% of cardiac cells in myocardium can generateelectrical impulses (or action potentials) spontaneously
- Sinoatrial node (SA node), is responsible for normalgeneration of signal that propagates from atria to ventricles
- SA node is a group of cells positionedon wall of right atrium, near entrance of superior vena cava; SA cells are modified cardiomyocytes
- They possess rudimentary contractile filaments, but contract relatively weakly compared to cardiac contractile cells

##### SA node function
- An action potential initiated at SA node first spreads throughout both atria; 2 specialized atrial conduction pathways facilitate its spread:
    - Interatrial pathways
    - Internodal pathways
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/P3jkWRb.png =350x)

#### Atrioventricular (AV) node
- Atrioventricular (AV) node slows conduction
- Slowed conduction allows time for atria to contract and to augment ventricular filling
- In resting state most of ventricular filling is completed during early diastole, ie. long before cardiac excitation starts in SA node
- Autonomic nervous system regulates AV conduction
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/E2bK5vj.png =250x)

##### AV node function
- Atrioventricular node (AV node) is located between left atrium and right ventricle within atrial septum
- AV node is also known as secondary pacemaker: cells there will take over pacemaker responsibility if SA node is dysfunctional
- Autorhythmic cells in AV node can function as pacemakersat a rate of 25 to 40 beats/min
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/qQ5QMWI.png =250x)

### Ectopic pacemaker activity
- If SA node does not function properly and is unable to control heart rate, a group of cells further down heart will lead generation of cardiac signal
- AV node will become ectopic pacemaker of heart
- Further down electrical conducting system of heart is Bundle of His
    - Left and right branches of this bundle, and Purkinje fibers, will also produce a spontaneous action potential at a rate of 30-40 beats per minute, so if SA and AV node both fail to function, these cells can become pacemakers
    - These cells will be initiating action potentials and contraction at a much lower rate than primary or secondary pacemaker cells

#### Bundle of His and purkinje fibers
- Bundle of His and purkinje fibers allow for a rapid spread of excitation throughout ventricles
    - Purkinje fibers distribute excitation to subendocardial myocytes
    - From here excitation spreads from myocyte to myocyte
- Rapid spreading of excitation throughout ventriclesensures coordinated contraction
- Purkinje fibers have a long refractory period which can block conduction of premature excitations of atria
- Purkinje fibers can act as pacemakers at very low frequency

## Conducting system overview
- SA node conducts to AV node
- AV node is only point where an action potential can spread from atria to ventricles
- From AV node, action potential spreads rapidly throughout ventricles, hastened by a specialized ventricular conduction system consisting of bundle of His and purkinje fibers
- Bundle of His bifurcates to left and right branches for both ventricles
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/JrWLsF3.png =250x)

## Signal propagation in cardiac muscle
- Cardiac muscle is a functional syncytium
- Following a depolarization ion channels in plasma membrane become refractory, i.e. membrane cannot be depolarized for a defined period of time
    - This ensures one-way propagation of action potentials across myocardial tissue
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/rBjbb8H.png =350x)

### Cardiac muscle cell membrane junctions
- Intercalated discs connect adjacent cardiac muscle cells; they contain 2 types of membrane junctions:
    1. Mechanically important desmosomes that hold cardiac muscle together 
    2. Electrically important gap junctions that link cells of each chamber into a functional syncytium
        - Electrical signals pass through gap junctions
        - Heart contracts as a coordinated unit
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/2esxUJn.png =250x)

### Action potential propagation through myocardium
- Excitation is also transmitted through myocardium by local currents acting ahead of action potential
- These currents discharge membrane ahead
- Since membrane to rear is in its refractory period, excitation proceeds unidirectionally
- Action potentials lead to very small changes in extracellular charge
- If many cells depolarize simultaneously a significant electrical field develops between depolarized and non-depolarized cells
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/5BuPdBb.png =300x)

## Impaired cardiac conduction
- Disturbances of cardiac conduction: affect rate or rhythm
- Tissue damage can cause changes in local ion concentrations and in ion channel function leading to abnormal rhythm: arrhythmia
- Changes in extracellular K^+^-ion levels can induce arrhythmia through effects on resting membrane potential
- A cardiac impulse may re-excite some myocardial region through which it had passed previously and which is no longer refractory; this phenomenon is called 're-entry' and can cause cardiac arrhythmia

## Abnormal heart rates
- Arrhythmias are uncoordinated atrial and/or ventricular contractions caused by a defect in conduction system
    - Tachyarrhythmias
    - Bradyarrhythmias
- Cardiac arrhythmias are irregularities in heartbeat, including when it is too fast or too slow
    - A heart rate that is too fast (above 100 beats per minute in adults) is called tachycardia, and a heart rate that is too slow (below 60 beats per minute) is called bradycardia
- Disturbances of impulse:
    - Generation: abnormal pacemaker activity
    - Conduction: disturbance of impulse (synchronisation)
    - Combination of both

### Tachyarrhythmias
- Common
- Often benign (but may reflect underlying heart disease)
- Often intermittent, causing diagnostic difficulty
- Occasionally severe, causing cardiac compromise.
- Causes:
    - Cardiac: MI, coronary artery disease, LV aneurysm, mitral valve disease, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, myocarditis, aberrant conduction pathways
    - Noncardiac: caffeine, smoking, alcohol, pneumonia, drugs (β2-agonists, digoxin, L-dopa, tricyclics, doxorubicin), metabolic imbalance (K^+^, Ca^2+^, Mg^2+^, hypoxia, hypercapnia, metabolic acidosis, thyroid disease), and phaeochromocytoma
- Presentation: palpitation, chest pain, presyncope/syncope, hypotension, or pulmonary oedema

#### Life-threatening tachyarrhythmias
- An atrial fibrillation: SA node is no longer controlling heart rate
    - Can cause clotting and inefficient filling of ventricles
    - Continuous uncoordinated excitation of the atria, no effective atrial contraction (blood stasis and high risk of thrombosis)
- A ventricular fibrillation: loss of coordination of electrical activity, should be treated instantly
    - Ventricles pump without filling and if rhythm is not rapidly reestablished circulation is non-functional and brain death occurs
- Emergency treatment: cefibrillation is application of an electrical stimulus to shock heart back into a normal SA rhythm
    - For chronic conditions, “pacemakers” can be implanted; this device delivers an electrical stimulus rather than SA node

### Bradyarrhythmias
- Heart block occurs when propagation of electrical signals that progress from atria to ventricles is impaired
- Location of block:
    - SA
    - AV
    - Bundle of His
    - Left or right bundle branches
    - Fascicles of left bundle branch
- SA and AV node blocks are each divided into 3 degrees, with second degree blocks being divided into 2 types (written either "type I or II" or "type 1 or 2")
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/IWlMjKX.png =300x)

#### Heart block I: first-degree heart block
- First-degree heart block occurs when electrical impulse moves through heart’s AV node more slowly than normal slowed signal processing
    - This usually results in a slower heart rate
- Condition may cause dizziness or light-headedness, or it may cause no symptoms at all
- First-degree heart block may not require specific treatment, but regular check-ups are required
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/dEosklE.png =150x)
- First-degree heart block can be caused by certain medications as a side effect:
    - Digitalis: this medication is commonly used to slow down heart rate; if it’s taken in high dosages or for a long period, digitalis can cause first-degree heart block
    - Beta blockers: these drugs inhibit part of nervous system that speeds up heart; this can have side effect of delaying electrical conduction within heart, which can cause first-degree heart block
    - Calcium channel blockers: among their other effects, calcium channel blockers can slow down conduction within heart’s AV node, resulting in first-degree heart block

#### Heart block II: second-degree heart block
- Second-degree heart block occurs when electrical signals from atria don’t always reach ventricles: intermittent signal processing; can result in “dropped beats”
- Symptoms include:
    - Chest pain
    - Fainting (syncope)
    - Heart palpitations
    - Shortness of breath
    - Rapid breathing
    - Nausea
    - Excessive fatigue
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/0rMlrPG.png =200x)
- Second-degree heart block can be classified in 2 ways:
    - Mobitz type 1: 
        - Commonly referred to as Wenckebach block, Mobitz type 1 may not cause noticeable symptoms
        - However, it could precede more serious type of second-degree heart block, Mobitz Type 2
        - Thus, Mobitz Type 1 should be monitored regularly
    - Mobitz type 2: 
        - In this type of second-degree heart block, conductive dysfunction impacts heart’s ability to pump blood throughout body
        - Often, a treatment with pacemaker is necessary

#### Heart block III: third-degree heart block
- Third-degree, or complete, heart block means that electrical signals can’t pass at all from atria to ventricles: complete conduction failure
- In absence of electrical impulses from SA node, ventricles contract at a slower rate
- The heart does not contract properly: systemic circulation is severely impaired
- Symptoms for third-degree heart block include:
    - Chest pain
    - Fainting (syncope)
    - Dizziness
    - Excessive fatigue
    - Shortness of breath
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/lR5wYSp.png =175x)
- A temporary or permanent pacemaker is used to treat third-degree heart block, providing a carefully timed electrical impulse to heart muscle
- Third-degree heart block require immediate medical attention
- Their unreliable heartbeats heighten risk of cardiac arrest

#### Bundle branch block
- Types of bundle branch blocks:
    - Left BBB
    - Right BBB
    - Bifascicular block
    - Trifascicular block
- A person with bundle branch block may experience no symptoms, especially in absence of any other problems
- In such cases, bundle branch block is usually first identified by testing for some other reason, such as a routine physical
- ECG reveals bundle branch block
- Often, no treatment is required for bundle branch block, but it’s still important to have regular check-ups
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/2zqpZqp.png =200x)

#### Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
- Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is caused by presence of extra electrical conductive tissue between atria and ventricles, resulting in a re-entry pathway, which may lead to tachycardias and arrhythmias
- LBBB causes:
    - IHD
    - Hypertension
    - Cardiac hypertrophy
    - Fibrosis
- RBBB causes:
    - Normal variant (isolated RBBB)
    - Pulmonary embolism
    - Cor pulmonale
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/fyj43P1.png =250x)

## Treatment of conduction defects
- Pacemaker therapy of AV conduction defects: a pacemaker can detect depolarization of the atrium induced by SA node, and after an adequate time delay to deliver an electrical impulse to ventricle

### Pacemaker therapy of conduction defects
- Pacemakers supply electrical initiation to myocardial contraction
- Pacemaker lies subcutaneously where it may be programmed through skin as necessary
- Pacemakers usually last 5–10 yrs, but usually only box needs replacing
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/iyv3bpm.png =250x)
- Indications for temporary cardiac pacing:
    - After acute anterior MI, prophylactic pacing is required in:
        - Complete AV block
        - Mobitz type I AV block (Wenckebach)
        - Mobitz type II AV block
        - Non-adjacent bifascicular, or trifascicular block.
    - Symptomatic bradycardia, unresponsive to atropine
    - Suppression of drug-resistant tachyarrhythmias
    - Special situations: During general anaesthesia; during cardiac surgery; during electrophysiological studies; drug overdose with digoxin, β-blockers or verapamil
- Indications for a permanent pacemaker:
    - Complete AV block
    - Mobitz type II AV block
    - Persistent AV block after anterior MI
    - Symptomatic bradycardias 
    - Drug-resistant tachyarrhythmias
    - Heart failure
