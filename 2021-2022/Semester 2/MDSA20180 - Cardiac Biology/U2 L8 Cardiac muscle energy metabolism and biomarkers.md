## Heart energy
- Heart muscle contains abundant mitochondria that run: β-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP

## Cardiac energy metabolism
- Normal cardiac function is dependent on a constant resynthesis of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria
    - Healthy heart gets 60-90% of its energy for oxidative phosphorylation from fatty acid oxidation, with balance from lactate and glucose
    - ATP is used for contraction (about 2/3) and for ion pumps (about 1/3)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/IWAoW4b.png =225x)
- Heart has sustained high energy demands in order to pump sufficient blood through body
    - This pump function is dependent on contractility of ventricular cardiomyocytes
    - If contractility increases, more ATP is required for myofibrillar shortening as well as for excitation–contraction coupling (ion pumps), which is dependent on ATP

### Major fuels of heart tissue
- Major fuels of heart tissue:
    - Fatty acids: 60% (complete oxidation of one molecule of palmitic acid (C16) yields 106 molecules of ATP)
    - Glucose: 27%
    - Lactate: 10% (released into blood by skeletal muscle during exercise)
    - Ketone bodies: 2%
    - Pyruvate: 1%
- Cardiac muscle has a limited ability to store glycogen (about 20% of that of skeletal muscle)
- Cardiac muscle does not synthesize fatty acids de novo (ATP is not used for this process)

### Myocardial oxygen consumption
- High oxidative capacity, heart tissue is rich in mitochondria
- Heart: 0.5% of total body weight, but responsible for 10% of body's O~2~ consumption
- Myocardial oxygen demand is amount of oxygen that heart requires to maintain optimal function
- Myocardial oxygen supply is amount of oxygen provided to heart by blood which is controlled by coronary arteries
- Myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) is defined by equation:
    - MVO2 = coronary blood flow x arteriovenous difference in O~2~ content
- Average value for a heart of 300 g is 30 to 35 ml/min
    - In a resting human myocardial oxygen consumption represents:

### Cardiac glycolysis
- Cardiac cells express a specific bifunctional enzyme pair: 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PF-2-K) / fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase
    - PF-2-K is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Protein kinase A or PKA) resulting in increased production of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, a potent allosteric stimulator of glycolytic enzymes, thus triggering process of glycolysis
    - Note: in liver, phosphorylation of a different isoform of PF-2-K leads to inhibition of fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase production, thus inhibiting glycolysis to conserve glucose for use of other tissues
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/pzoBTZ6.png =350x)
- A series of enzymatic reactions of glycolysis convert glucose to pyruvate, which may be reduced to lactate or further catabolized by tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)
    - Glycolysis‐derived ATP plays a crucial role in maintaining contractile function of heart
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/dLYKlVy.png =250x)
- Sympathetic nervous sytem stimulates glycolysis in cardiac myocytes
    - Glycolysis is stimulated by epinephrine (adrenaline) signalling in cardiac muscle cells to meet increased need for ATP during exercise
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/TN7PnrU.png =350x)

### Creatine phosphokinase
- Creatine phosphokinase (CPK or CK) catalyzes formation of creatine phosphate, a storage form of ATP in muscle tissue
    - CK allows fast regeneration of ATP
    - Stores of creatine phosphate are sufficient for ~ 15 heart beats:
        - Creatine phosphate + ADP ⇌ creatine + ATP
    - Mitochondrial and cytosolic CK cooperate to contribute to transport of ATP from mitochondria into cytosol (creatine phosphate diffuses through mitochondrial membrane)
    - ATP-ADP translocase is main transporter of ADP and ATP; it exchanges ATP with ADP across inner mitochondrial membrane
- CK activity is 1 of markers of acute myocardial infarction 
    - Skeletal muscle damage also leads to elevated CK levels in serum
    - CK is a dimeric enzyme composed of M and B subunits
        - CK-2 (isoforms M+B) is somewhat specific for cardiac muscle 

    | Isoenzyme | Subunit composition | Present in |
    | -------- | -------- | -------- |
    | CK-1 | BB | Brain |
    | CK-2 | MB | Heart (skeletal muscle) |
    | CK-3 | MM | Skeletal muscle (heart) |

### Cardiac troponins
- Troponins (Tn) are cytoskeletal proteins that consist of 3 subunits: TnI, TnT, and TnC
    - TnI binds actin and inhibits actin/myosin interactions
    - TnT binds tropomyosin
    - TnC binds calcium
    - Ca^2+^ elevation leads to structural changes in Tn complex, resulting in displacement of tropomyosin and enabling interaction between actin and myosin and contraction
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/6yrfS1Y.png =350x)
- Antibodies are available that specifically recognize cardiac TnI (cTnI) and TnT (cTnT) but not skeletal muscle isoforms
    - TnC is identical in cardiac and skeletal muscle, and therefore not suitable as biomarker
    - Cardiac troponins (cTn) have a greater sensitivity and specificity for MI than CK-MB
    - After cell damage initially cytosolic cTn (3-6% of total cTn) are released followed by myofibrillar cTn

## Cardiac biomarkets for acute MI
- 3 biomarkers are used for detection of acute MI: 
    1. CK-MB
    2. Troponins
    3. Myoglobin
- CK-MB levels increase within 3–12h of onset of chest pain, reach peak values within 24h, and return to baseline after 48–72h
    - Sensitivity is ~95%, with high specificity
- Cardiac troponin levels (T and I) are most sensitive and specific markers of myocardial necrosis
    - Serum levels increase within 3–12h from onset of chest pain, peak at 24–48h, and reduce to baseline over 5–14 days
- Myoglobin levels rise within 1–4h from onset of pain
    - They are highly sensitive but not specific

### Biomarkers following acute MI
- Clot formation in a coronary artery can lead to loss of blood supply resulting in death of cardiac myocytes (myocardial infarction)
- Dying cells release (mainly cytosolic) cellular proteins which appear in extracellular space and in blood
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/rHhfy2q.png =350x)

### Enzyme changes following acute MI
- If normal ≥6h after onset of pain, and ECG normal, risk of missing MI is tiny (0.3%)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/7ocKkwG.png =350x)

## Acute coronary syndrome 
- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) includes unstable angina pectoris and evolving MI, which share a common underlying pathology—plaque rupture, thrombosis, and inflammation
- Usually ACS is divided into:
    - ACS with ST-segment elevation or new onset LBBB; and
    - ACS without ST-segment elevation (ECG may show ST depression, T wave inversion, non-specific changes, or be normal)
- Degree of irreversible myocyte death varies, and significant necrosis can occur without ST elevation
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/EQNS2AX.png =350x)
- Only difference between STEMI and Non-STEMI is that in STEMI there will be ST elevation on ECG - it will be normal in Non-STEMI
    - That’s why you need cardiac biomarkers for diagnosis
    - Diagnosis of ACS is based on 2 out of 3:
        1.Hx
        2-ECG
        3-Cardiac enzyme
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/NgZAv6L.png =250x)

### Biomarkers for ACS
#### Myoglobin 
- Myoglobin is a cytosolic transporter for oxygen in muscle tissue
- Myoglobin levels rise very rapidly (faster than troponin), however, myoglobin has a very low specificity for cardiac muscle
- Skeletal muscle injury or disease also result in increased blood myoglobin levels
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/XKJE311.png =250x)

#### FABP 
- Heart-type fatty acid binding protein (FABP) is a small cytosolic protein that has been suggested as early marker of myocardial infarction
- FABP binds fatty acids and increases their solubility in cell, and facilitates transport of fatty acids to different cellular compartments (lipid droplets, mitochondria, peroxisomes)
- FABP as a biomarker for ACS is still under development
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/21Dxqq9.png =350x)

### Management of ACS depending on biomarkers and ECG findings
- Monitor ECG every 15 to 30 minutes according to hospital guidelines
    - If enzymes "-" repeat them in 6 hours
    - If enzymes "-" repeat them in 12 hours
    - If enzymes "+" and if there are no ECG findings: follow treatment protocol for non-STEMI
    - If enzymes "+" for STEMI and there are ECG findings, proceed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI if <12 hours) or thrombolysis
