## Cardiac output
- CO = HR x SV
    - Cardiac output (CO) is volume of blood pumped by each ventricle per minute
    - CO is product of heart rate (HR), or number of heart beats per minute (bpm), and stroke volume (SV), which is volume of blood pumped from a ventricle per beat
- BP = CO x TPR
    - Blood pressure (BP) is determined by cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR)
- Inotropy = force
    - Contraction of myocardium (sometimes refers to contractility)
- Chronotrophy = rate
    - Firing of sinoatrial node (sometimes refers to heart rate)
- Stroke volume (SV): volume of blood ejected from a ventricle for each cardiac cycle is approximately 70–75ml
- Cardiac output (CO): 
    - Equal on both sides of heart
    - Average CO = ~ 5L/min at rest 
    - Can increase 5-fold during exercise
- In a healthy system SV is fairly constant
    - If blood volume drops or if heart weakens, then SV declines and CO is maintained by increasing HR

## Overview of cardiovascular system
- Structures:
    - Heart: dual pump
    - Blood vessels: passageways
    - Blood: transport medium
- Key functions: 
    - Transport
        - Oxygen and carbon dioxide
        - Absorbed products of digestion
        - Metabolic wastes (to liver and kidneys)
        - Hormones, immune cells, proteins
    - Regulation
        - Hormones
        - Thermoregulation (skin blood flow)
    - Protection
        - Blood clotting (protects against haemorrhage)
        - Pathogens (immune system)

### 3 main elements of circulation 
1. Heart
2. Pulmonary circulation 
3. Systemic circulation

### Route of blood through body
- (Deoxygenated blood) vena cava → right atrium → right ventricle → pulmonary artery → (pulmonary circulation) lungs → (oxygenated blood) left atrium → left ventricle → pulmonary veins → aorta → (systemic circulation) vena cava again

## Unidirectional blood flow
- Pressure within chambers of heart varies with heartbeat cycle
- Pressure difference drives blood flow: high to low pressure
- Normal direction of flow: atria to ventricles, then ventricles to arteries
- All valves open passively based on pressure gradient
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/aL6QJxk.png =450x)

### Valves of heart
- Atrioventricular valves: atria → ventricles
    - RA → RV = tricuspid
    - LA → LV = bicuspid (mitral)
- Semilunar valves: ventricles → arteries 
    - LV → aorta = aortic semilunar valve
    - RV → pulmonary artery = pulmonary semilunar valve
    - RA = right atrium
    - LA = left atrium
    - RV = right ventricle
    - LV = left ventricle
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Gj0jBVU.png =350x)
- Preventing eversion of valves:
    - Eversion of atrioventricular (AV) valves is prevented by tension on valve leaflets exerted by chordae tendineae when papillary muscles contract
    - Eversion of semilunar (SL) valves is prevented by their structure
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/yF1Q7CA.png =350x)

#### Valves opening and closing
- Atrioventricular (AV) valve open when
    - Atrial pressure > ventricular pressure
- Aortic/pulmonary aorta valve open when
    - Ventricular pressure > aortic/PA pressure
- Atrioventricular (AV) valve close when
    - Atrial pressure < ventricular pressure
- Aortic/pulmonary aorta valve close when
    - Ventricular pressure < aortic/PA pressure
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/jkP3eGV.png =150x)

#### Dysfunctional valves
- Don’t open correctly: causes increased resistance to blood flow, known as stenosis
- Don’t close completely: blood regurgitation 
    - Heart’s ability to function and pump blood is inefficient and can lead to heart failure
    - Causes: congenital, infective endocarditis, ischaemic heart disease

- Diagnosis: 
    - Echocardiogram
    - CT/MRI
    - Cardiac catherization

## Overview of cardiac cycle
- Cardiac Cycle = one complete heartbeat 
- Rhythmic contraction and relaxation generates heart pumping action:
    - Contraction pushes blood out of heart into vasculature, it is termed as systole
    - Relaxation allows heart to fill with blood, termed as diastole 
- Both atria contract as a unit 
- Both ventricles contract as a unit 
- Atrial contraction precedes ventricular
- Human heart averages 75 cardiac cycles per minute, with each cardiac cycle occurring in approximately 0.8 seconds

### Sounds of heart
- Heart sounds: ‘lub (S1)’-‘dub(S2)’ mark beginning and end of systole
    - Produced by closing of AV and SL valves

### Cardiac cycle phases
- 4 main phases 
    - Based on positions of atrioventricular (inlet) and semilunar (outlet) valves 
    1. Ventricular filling: diastole (0.5 sec long)
        - AV valves open when A > V
        - Ventricles are filled passively 
        - Atrial contraction
        - Ventricles contract
    3. Isovolumetric contraction: systole (0.05 sec long)
        - Isovolumetric = no change in the volume of blood
        - Ventricles contract but no ejection of blood 
    4. Ventricular ejection: systole (0.3 sec long)
        - Aortic valve opens because V > BV
        - Ventricular ejection
        - Rapid then reduces
        - Ventricular pressure drops
    5. Isovolumetric relaxation: diastole (0.08 sec long)
        - Aortic valve closes because V < BV
        - Isovolumetric relaxation
        - Pressure falls in ventricles 
        - AV valve opens because A > V
        - Ventricles relax but no change in blood volume

### Cardiac cycle summary
![](https://i.imgur.com/nDzw2Av.png =450x)

## Stroke volume
- Stroke Volume = end diastolic volume – end systolic volume
    - SV is vol of blood pumped from left ventricle per beat
    - EDV is vol of blood in ventricle just before ejection
    - ESV is vol of blood in ventricle just after ejection
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/DthhJe2.png =450x)
- Vary between males and females
- Peak in adolescence and early childhood (males especially)

### Ejection fraction
- Ratio of systolic volume ejected in 1 beat (SV) to volume contained in ventricle immediately prior to ejection (EDV)
    - Ejection Fraction (EF) = SV/EDV
    - For example EF = 80ml/120ml = 0.67 = 67%
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/OauzGAI.png =450x)

#### EF for diagnosis of heart failure
- Heart failure is a long-term condition in which heart can't pump blood well enough to meet body's needs all the time
