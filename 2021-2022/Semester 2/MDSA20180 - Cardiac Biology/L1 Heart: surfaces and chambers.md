###### tags: `MDSA20180 - Cardiac Biology`

## Learning objectives
- Describe the anatomical position and orientation of the heart
- Describe the anatomy and structure of the pericardium
- Define the surfaces and borders of the heart
- Describe the anatomy of the four heart chambers

## Heart structure
### Heart has 4 chambers, 2 sides
- Left and right atriums and ventricles
- Left side pumps blood around body
- Right side receives deoxygenated blood
- If we have a cardiac output at rest of 5L/ min we must also have a venous return of 5L/ min 
    - If venous return is changed in any way it will have an effect on blood flow

### Heart anterior side
- Heart viewed from the front (recommended to practice drawing it to learn)
    - Superior vena cava and inferior vena cava (rather short)
    - Right atrium
    - Right ventricle
        - Most of what is in front is the right ventricle
        - Stab wounds most likely effect right ventricle
    - Left ventricle
        - Only small bit showing
    - Base of pulmonary artery is anterior to the aorta

### Sinuses
#### Transverse pericardial sinus 
- Formed as a result of folding of the heart tube in an embryo
- Separates the arterial vessels and the venous vessels
    - Located posteriorly to the ascending aorta and anteriorly to the SVC
    - Superior to the left atrium 
- Surgical significance: with 1 motion, can pass finger through and locate and ligate (tie off) coronary arteries during coronary artery bypass
    - In an emergency, can rapidly put person on a bypass circuit 
    - If you can control fthese 2 vessels, can control the whole circuit of blood

#### Oblique sinus
- Found on posterior surface
- J-shaped surrounding the SVC, IVC and pulmonary veins
- A hand placed under the apex moving superiorly would slip into the oblique sinus

## Location
### Mediastinum
- Heart is located in the mediastinum which can be divided into 2 major parts
    - Superior and inferior
- Inferior has 3 parts
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/C2YJ1XS.png =350x)

### Surface anatomy
- Manubriosternal joint = "angle of louis" = sternal angle
    - The synarthrotic joint formed by articulation of the manubrium (top of sternum) and the body of the sternum
    - Located at 2nd costal cartilage
    - Palpable clinical landmark
        - You can feel the angle of louis and while examining a patient you can know that this is the start of the second intercostal space
        - You can then count down to the 5th and this is the location of the apex of the heart

### Surrounding pericardium
- Tough fibrous sac
- Filled with lubricating fluid
- Encases heart with a number of layers each made of a single sheet of epithelial cells
    1. Outermost layer of pericardium: fibrous layer
        - Can't be strecthced: non complient, inextensible sac
    2. Parietal layer of serous pericardium
        - Lines internal surface of fibrous pericardium
    3. Layer of serous fluid
    4. Visceral layer of serous pericardium (epicardium)
        - Outer layer of chamber of heart
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ieZSYGw.png =400x)
- Ligaments of pericardium stabilise heart and minimise jolts (applied mechanical forces on the heart can interfere with rhythm and hence need to be minimised):
    1. Phreno-pericardial ligaments: tether heart to diaphragm
    2. Superior sterno-pericardial ligaments: attach pericardium to surface of sternum
    3. Xipho-pericardial ligaments: attach right ventrical to xiphoid process
    4. Vertebro-pericardial ligaments

## Orientation
- 1/3 on right side of the body, 2/3 on the left 
- Long axis lies parallel to the interventricular septum
- Short axis is perpendicular to the long axis at the level of the atrioventricular valve

## Clinical considerations
### Cardiac tamponade
- If heart fills with blood or fluid the pericardial sac will not stretch to accommodate
    - Causes are varied including haemopericardium (blood in pericardium which is expected from trauma) and pericarditis
- Rigidity means that the heart is subject to resulting increased pressure 
- Can compress blood vessels entering and leaving heart compromising cardiac output 
- Serious life threatening 
    - Increasingly common to carry ultrasound probes to see if there is a lot of fluid in the pericardial sac making it easier to diagnose 
- Becks triad describes the signs 
    1. Low BP 
    2. Muffled heart sounds when listening with stethoscope 
    3. Distension of jugular vein 
- Chest x-ray for this can show the “water bottle sign”
    - Shape shown from x-ray looks like a water bottle shape: not showing shape of the heart but of the pericardium with the heart in the fluid somewhere 
- Emergency treatment is to make a drain

### Pericarditis
- Inflammation of the pericardium 
- Conditions can cause the serous fluid to increase 
    - Linked with bacterial infection and myocardial infarction 
- Painful condition linked with a distinctive posture (classic sign) 
    - Sat up leaned over their knees which makes the pain less by minimising load of the tendons of pericardium
    - Most painful position is to lie out flat as it stretches ligaments due to gravity of the heart

## Heart: breakdown
- Described as a pyramid that has fallen on its side 
- Apex 
    - Tip of the left ventricle located approx. directly down from mid clavical 
        - 5th left intercostal space at the mid-clavicular line 
    - When contracting the heart rotates a little bit and the apex hits off the chest wall
    - This is what you can feel when feeling chest for heart beat 
    - If the heart is enlarged the apex beat could be much further over 
- Base 
    - Mainly left atrium 
    - Anterior to the oesophagus 
        - To monitor activity of left atrium can often be done through the oesophagus 
- Surfaces (3D concept) 
    - Right pulmonary surface: mainly RA 
    - Left pulmonary surface: LV 
        - Leaves cardiac impression on left lung 
    - Anterior/ sternocostal surface: RV
    - Inferor/ diaphragmatic surface: mainy LV 
        - Rests above central tendon of diaphragm
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/PdPsEiF.png =350x)
- 4 borders (2D concept)
    - Left: mainly left ventrical (LV)
    - Right: right atrium (RA) between superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC)
    - Superior: RA, LA, auricles and great vessels
    - Inferior: mainly RV plus some LV

### Transverse section through atria
![](https://i.imgur.com/X6Q5FyO.png =400x)
- Pulmonary vessels enter at this level
- There is a right and left auricle
    - Atrium = upper heart chambers; auricle = ear like conical muscular pouch that arise from each atrium 
    - Auricles consist of pectinate muscles 
        - Pectinate muscles are parallel ridges in walls of the atria of the heart 
        - In ventricles there are trabeculae carneae which are irregular rather than parallel 
    - Between pectinate muscles and smooth muscle is crista terminalis, a smooth muscular ridge between the 2 layers

### Features in chambers
#### Right atrium
- Opening of IVC
- Annulus fossae ovalis: ring shape structure 
    - Prominent rounded margin of fossa ovalis 
- Fossa ovalis: oval shaped depression
    - During development there is no point of using lungs as they are full of fluid 
    - Body develops ways to bypass lungs by moving blood straight from left to right ventricle
    - Before birth this closes up and we are left with fossa ovalis in the interatrial septum 
    - Patent Foramen Ovale
        - Congenital defect resulting in hole not closing and then called patent foramen ovale
        - Results in potential for right-to-left shunt between the two atria 
    - Opening of coronary sinus 
        - Coronary sinus is a collection of veins joined together to form a large vessel that collects blood from the heart muscle and delivers it to the right artrium 
    - Tricuspid valve 
        - 3 cusp valve allowing flow from RA to RV
    - Preferential streaming of blood from the SVC and IVC into right atrium 
        - SVC blood towards tricuspid 
        - IVC blood toward the fossa ovalis 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/lz3bWgN.png =450x)

#### Right ventricle
- Attached to cusps of tricuspid valve are the chordae tendinae 
    - Attach to papillary muscles 
    - The 3 right ventricular papillary muscles originate in ventricular wall and attach to anterior, posterior and septal cusps of the tricuspid valve vie chordae tendinae
- Moderator band 
    - A band of muscle which carries part of the conducting system of the right bundle branch to the anterior papillary muscle 
    - Right bundle branch is a division of the atrioventricular bundle (bundle of His) from the conducting system of the heart 
- Trabeculae carneae: rounded irregular muscular columns which project from the inner surface of the left and right ventricles of the heart 
- Pulmonary valve 
    - Valve between RV and pulmonary artery 
    - 3 cusps 
    - Semilunar valve (1 of 2)
- Conus arteriosus oextension of the right ventricle in the heart from which pulmonary artery originates
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/VIPG5pT.png =400x)

#### Left atrium
- Fossa ovalis 
- Left atrial appendage 
    - Extension of the left atrium that pumps oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left ventricle 
- Mitral valve (bicuspid valve) 
    - Valve between left atrium and LV allowing filling of LV 
    - 2 cusps 
- Pulmonary vein ostia 
    - Right and left pulmonary veins enter the posterior left atrial wall transporting oxygenated blood from the lungs to LA
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/5B1IM13.png =300x)

#### Left ventricle
- Much thicker than right V in an adult 
    - About 2-3x thicker than RV
    - Allows for high pressure to send blood around the body 
    - Important for RV to not be too strong as is getting sent to really tiny alveoli in the lungs which are fragile: pressure needs to be strong enough to drive flow but not to damage the small structures 
- Aortic valve 
    - Between left ventricle and aorta allowing blood to be ejected from LV into aorta 
    - Semilunar valve (2 of 2) 
    - 3 cusps 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/EiemlSD.png =250x)

## Work calculations
- Pressure x volume = work of the heart
- To increase work of the heart you increase pressure or volume 
- If there is long standing high blood pressure the heart will be “pressure loaded”
    - Ventricle gets much thicker inwards 
    - The work the heart is doing will be much greater which can result in heart failure 
- Can have a mixture of pressure and volume load in the heart
