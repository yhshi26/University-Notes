## Electrical activity of heart
- Heart electrical activity is synchronized
- Distance and amplitude of spread depends on size of potentials and synchronicity of potentials from other cells
- ECG can detect abnormal heart rates and rhythms and heart muscle damage:
    - Abnormalities in rate
    - Abnormalities in rhythm
    - Cardiac myopathies

### ECG as a diagnostic tool
- Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an crucial diagnostic tool for:
    - Disturbances in rhythm and conduction
    - Extent, location and progress of ischaemic cardiac damage
    - Effects of altered electrolyte concentrations
    - Influence of some drugs on heart
    - Anatomical orientation of heart

### ECG recording principles
- When cells in heart undergo a change in membrane potential, an electrical field is set up within the body
- This can be detected as a difference in electrical potential (a voltage) between 2 electrodes attached to surface of body
- A record of this potential difference is called an electrocardiogram (ECG)
- Bipolar standard limb leads are recorded by measuring voltage difference between 2 limb electrodes

#### Bipolar limb leads
- We can record 3 bipolar limb leads:
    - LEAD I: left arm (+) → right arm (-)
    - LEAD II: left leg (+) → right arm (-)
    - LEAD III: left leg (+) → left arm (-)

- Augmented limb leads are recorded by measuring a voltage difference between 1 positive electrode and a combination of multiple other limb electrodes acting as 1 composite negative electrode

#### Augmented limb leads
- We can record 3 augmented limb leads:
    - aVL: left arm (+) → combined right arm and left leg (-)
    - aVR: right arm (+) → combined left arm and left leg (-)
    - aVF: Left leg (+) → combined right arm and left arm (-)

#### Precordial/chest leads
- Precordial/chest leads are recorded by measuring a voltage difference between 6 chest electrodes
- We can record 6 precordial/chest leads:
    - V1: 4th right intercostal space, sternal border
    - V2: 4th left intercostal space, sternal border
    - V3: midway between V2 and V4
    - V4: 5th left intercostal space, mid-clavicular line
    - V5: same level as V4, anterior axillary line
    - V6: same level as V4, mid-axillary line
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/jbb8NPj.png =275x)

##### Positioning of chest electrodes (v1-V6)
- Suprasternal notch is palpated and fingers drawn down to detect a clear prominence in sternum, known as angle of louis
    - 2nd intercostal space is found at same level as angle of louis
    - 4th intercostal space is found when palpating fingers are placed in 2nd intercostal space and drawn downwards
- V1: 4th intercostal space, to right of sternum
- V2: 4th intercostal space, to left of sternum
- V3: diagonally between V2 and V4
- V4: between rib 5 and 6 in midclavicular line
- V5: same level as V4, but in anterior axillary line
- V6: same level as V4 and V5, but in midaxillary line

### ECG common errors
- Most common errors in recording an ECG are attaching wrong wire to an electrode or incorrect placement of electrodes
- Lead switches are a common mistake when ECGs are made and can lead to wrong diagnoses
- Left-right arm reversals lead to a negative complex in lead I with a negative P wave in lead I

## ECG recording parameters
- ECG graph paper records:
    - Time (interval) between cardiac electrical events along horizontal axis 
    - Amplitude (voltage) of cardiac electrical events along vertical axis
- Standard paper speed is 25 mm/s

### ECG components
- Rules for naming elements of QRS complex are as follows:
    1. If first deflection of QRS complex is negative, it is a Q wave
    2. If first deflection is positive, it is an R wave
    3. A negative deflection which follows an R wave is an S wave
- PR interval is interval between beginning of P wave and QRS complex; it is time between beginning of P wave and R wave in the absence of a Q wave

#### ECG component durations

| Interval | Normal range(s) |
| -------- | --------------- |
| P wave | 0.08-0.10 |
| RR interval | 0.6-1.0 |
| PR interval | 0.12-0.2 |
| QRS duration | 0.08-0.10 |
| QT interval | 0.33-0.43 |
| QTc interval | <0.44 |

- QT interval normally decreases as heart rate increases
- QTc is QT interval corrected for heart rate and is calculated by dividing QT interval by square root of R-R interval (thus, QTc = QT/√RR)

### ECG rate
- Rate can be determined by counting number of P waves per minute (atrial rate) or number of QRS complexes per minute (ventricular rate)
- Normally each P wave is followed by a QRS complex so 2 rates will be identical
- If conduction through AV node fails after atrial depolarisation then atrial excitation will not enter ventricles and hence P wave will not be followed immediately by a QRS complex
- Another situation in which 2 rates may differ is if atrial rate is very high (>180 per minute) then even a normal AV node will not conduct every atrial excitation into ventricles
- Heart rate is calculated from the expression:
    - Heart Rate (min-1) = 60/RR interval (s)
- Normal ventricular rate is between 60 and 100 min-1; 1 small box is 0.04 sec, 1 large box is 0.2 seconds and 5 large boxes correspond to 1 second; thus, normal ventricular rate corresponds to between 5 large boxes between QRS intervals (60 min-1) and 3 large boxes between QRS intervals (100 min-1)
- Heart rate is also calculated by dividing number of large boxes (5 mm or 0.2 seconds) between 2 successive QRS complexes into 300
- Heart rate is also calculated by dividing number of small boxes (1 mm or 0.04 seconds) between 2 successive QRS complexes into 1500

### ECG rhythm
- Healthy cardiac rhythm results from regular discharge of SA node, propagated through cardiac conducting system in a normal manner
- This is referred to as normal sinus rhythm in which each P wave is followed by a QRS complex, and these occur at a relatively constant rate and regular rhythm
- In health, heart rate is always fluctuating slightly because of changes in activity of autonomic nerves supplying SA node; when we breathe in rate increases and when we breathe out rate decreases (this is called respiratory sinus arrhythmia and this heart rate variability is a sign of cardiac health)

### ECG intervals
- Timing of electrical events within heart indicates a normal rhythm and physiological contraction for efficient pumping of blood
- 2 most frequently measured intervals are PR interval and QT interval
- PR interval is time between onset of P wave and onset of QRS complex
- QT interval is time between onset of QRS complex and end of T wave

### ECG component functions

| Component | Function |
| --------- | -------- |
| P wave | atrial depolarisation |
| QRS complex | ventricular depolarisation |
| T wave | ventricular repolarisation |
| PR interval | time for AP to travel through atria and AV node (PR segment: AV nodal delay) |
| QT interval | duration of ventricular action potential |

#### ECG and cardiac action potential
- Depolarization and repolarization of  cardiac mycocytes  generates an extracellular electric field between cells
- ECG is a recording of extracellular potential changes at skin surface over time
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/HhgRZeh.png =250x)

##### Figure 1
- Figure: during depolarization (red area) of a strip of cardiac muscle an extracellular potential difference moves across tissue within a certain time
    - Continuous recording of potential results in appearance of a wave
    - Polarity of recorded potential depends on position of electrode (A, B)
    - No potential is recorded when strip is not depolarized or fully depolarized (blue downwards arrow)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/EP4SpSV.png =450x)

##### Figure 2
- Current flows between different areas of heart either when some areas have depolarized and others are still to depolarize or, conversely, when some areas have repolarized and others are still to repolarize
    - Depolarized cells are with excess of negative charge, which flows in direction of depolarization wavefront

##### Figure 3
- Figure: timing of ECG waves compared with intracellular  recordings of cardiac action potentials
    - Subepicardial myocytes (pink trace) have more repolarizing K^+^-channels than subendocardial myocytes, so they repolarize first

##### Figure 4
- P wave reflects time course for spread of atrial depolarization
- Conduction through AV node occurs during isoelectric portion of PR interval
- QRS duration indicates time for ventricular depolarization, and QT interval is used as a measure of time for ventricular repolarization
