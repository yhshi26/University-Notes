## Cardiac electrical field
- During depolarization and repolarization heart generates an electrical field which can be described as an electrical dipole having a negative and positive centre; dipole can be represented by an arrow (vector)
- Direction and magnitude of electrical field (dipole) change continuously over time during cardiac de/re-polarization
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/iD7rwEj.png =250x)
- Grey areas indicate non-excited myocytes (positive extracellular charge), red areas indicate depolarized myocytes (negative extracellular charge)
- During ventricular depolarization (duration of 90 ms) direction of ventricular dipole rotates anticlockwise
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/owvEKFA.png =450x)
- Electrical charges generated by cardiac de/re-polarization are conducted to body surface
- Lead electrodes are used to measure magnitude of electrical field at certain body positions over time

### Vector of electrical field
- Direction and magnitude of electrical field can be represented by a vector (d)
- Cardiac vector can be resolved into components (V~1~, V~2~)
    - Magnitude of field detected by V~1~ or V~2~ depending on their angles relative to d
- A certain recording or lead detects component directed at it
    - At a 90 degree angle relative to d, magnitude in recording lead would be 0 (electrical field would not be detected)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/exZ8ITL.png =450x)
- In bipolar lead recordings, apparent magnitude of field varies across different leads due to their localization in relation to vector d
    - Vector d can be reconstructed using Einthoven's triangle
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/VNJ1Ojz.png =450x)

### Einthoven's triangle
- In Einthoven system, cardiac vector is considered to lie in center of an equilateral triangle whose apices are located in left and right shoulders and pubic region
- For convenience electrodes are connected to:
    - Both arms and left leg (extensions of left/right shoulder and pubis) resulting in recordings/ of leads I, II, III
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/MKROjZx.png =150x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/D8AxTsB.png =250x)
- Standard limb leads (I, II, III) record projections of cardiac electrical activity on a frontal plane of body
- Limb lead recordings can be used to construct ‘real’ vector d (cardiac electrical axis)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/rLwXjp9.png =250x)
- Changing magnitude and direction of ventricular dipole during depolarization (red vectors) appear differently in different leads (QRS)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/L3ymfTO.png =350x)
- Augmented limb leads (aVR, aVL, aVF) use same electrodes as I, II, III, but combine 2 electrodes into a new negative electrode
- This generates a new reference point (-) on Einthoven’striangle along line between combined electrodes
- Augmented limb leads bisect angles of Einthoven triangle resulting in new angles in frontal plane
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/VG74A1A.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/I2GlA2d.png =250x)
- All limb leads can be combined into a system, where each lead is assigned a particular angle relative to a horizontal line at heart level
- If QRS axis is about +60º, largest QRS complex usually appears in lead II
- Normal range of mean frontal QRS axis is mean direction of cardiac vector during ventricular depolarization

#### Cardiac vector in Einthoven's triangle
- In Einthoven system, cardiac vector is considered to lie in center of an equilateral triangle whose apices are located in left and right shoulders and pubic region
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/kREkYFf.png =150x)
- Determining ECG axis: mean frontal axis is sum of all ventricular forces during ventricular depolarization
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/8qTgcQk.png =250x)
- Steps to determine axis of heart:
    - Calculate mean QRS amplitude from leads I, II and III:
        - Mean QRS = + R - S - Q
        - 1mV = 10 mm: small square = 1mm; big one = 5mm
    - Mark on corresponding side of triangle
    - Drop a perpendicular line and show point of intersection
- Standard limb leads (I, II, III) record projections of cardiac electrical activity on body’s frontal plane; in Einthoven system, cardiac vector is considered to start from center of an equilateral triangle

## Physiological values of ECG axis
- As a simple rule of thumb, if complexes in leads I and II are both ‘positive’, axis is normal
- Normal axis is between –30 and +90 degrees
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/Hjraka7.png =175x)
- Left axis deviation (LAD) is –30 to -90 degrees: suggests left ventricular hypertrophy
- Right axis deviation (RAD) is +90 to +180 degrees: suggests right ventricular hypertrophy
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/VigjVvq.png =450x)

### Axis deviations
- Axis deviation can indicate a pathophysiological process
- Determine direction (left vs right) and amplitude (in degrees)

| LAD (left axis deviation) causes: | RAD (right axis deviation) causes: |
| -------- | -------- | 
| Left ventricular hypertrophy | Right ventricular hypertrophy|
| Ventricular tachycardia | Pulmonary embolism |
| Inferior MI | Anterolateral MI |
| WPW syndrome | WPW syndrome |
| Left anterior hemiblock | Left posterior hemiblock (rare) |

#### Left ventricular hypertrophy
- Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a condition in which there is an increase in left ventricular mass, due to an increase in wall thickness
- Most commonly, left ventricular wall thickening occurs in response to pressure overload

##### ECG of LVH

#### Right ventricular hypertrophy
- Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) is a heart disorder characterized by thickening of wall of right vetrncile due to abnormal enlargement of cardiac muscle
- Most commonly, right ventricular wall thickening occurs in response to pressure overload

## Overview of electrical axis of heart
- Calculate mean QRS amplitude from leads I, II and III:
    - Mean QRS = +R -S –Q
- Mark on corresponding side of Einthoven’s triangle
- Drop a perpendicular line and show point of intersection
- Draw vector and evaluate electrical axis of heart 
- Direction of mean QRS vector is usually -30 to +90 degrees
    - If vector is left of -30 degrees: left axis deviation (suggests left ventricular hypertrophy)
    - If vector is right of 90 degrees: right axis deviation (suggests right ventricular hypertrophy)
