## Cardiac pacemarkers
- Set rhythm of cardiac contraction
- Exhibit automaticity (spontaneous rhythmic action potential generation, also known as autorhythmic cells)
- Normal pacemaker is sinoatrial node (SA node)

### Cardiac conduction system

## Sinoatrial (SA) node 
- Dominant (not the only one, but is main) cardiac pacemaker
- Has an inherent capacity to generate 100 action potentials per minute, but is subject to regulation by autonomic nervous system and circulating hormones
- Healthy adult heart rate is ~70 bpm (range 60-100 bpm)

### SA node histology
- Mass of modified cardiac myocytes, 20 mm long and 4 mm wide
- Located in right atrial wall close to superior vena cava
- Compared with typical contractile cardiac muscle, cells are smaller, containing fewer myofibrils and fewer intercalated discs

## SA node electrical activity
- Note: SA node cells do not  possess a stable membrane potential, i.e. there is no resting membrane potential
- Membrane achieves a potential of about –60mV which decays to about –40mV
    - This slow decay is called pacemaker potential and is a consequence of a leak of Na^+^ ions into cell  with  a  contribution to its final third from a leak of Ca^2+^ into cell
    - At –40mV, threshold for an action potential is reached
- Upstroke phase is caused by Ca^2+^ entry
    - Cell repolarises as a consequence of inactivation of Ca^2+^ currents and activation of K^+^ current
    - Na^+^ current is inactivated before upstroke phase
- Cell repolarises to –60mV and process starts again
- Regular depolarisations are conducted through heart resulting in regular cardiac muscle contractions thus generating cardiac rhythm

### Control of heart rate
- Gradient of pacemaker potential can be regulated which permits regulation of heart rate
- SA node AP is also known as slow response AP because AP rising phase is much slower than that of ventricular cardiac muscle cell
- Note:

### (Slow response) action potential
1. There is no stable V~m~ (which is different to situation is ventricular cardiac muscle cell)
2. Most  negative V~m~ achieved is significantly less negative than that observed in ventricular muscle because there is a relative lack of K~ir~ channels
3. AP threshold is around -40 to -55mV which is more positive than that in ventricular myocytes (~-65mV)
4. Whereas ventricular muscle cell AP has 5 phases there are only 3 clear phases in SA node AP

### Delving deeper

    - Pacemaker potential is phase 4, the rising phase of AP is phase 0 and repolarising phase is phase 3

### Pacemaker potential
#### F-type (funny)/HCN channels
- Na^+^ influx occurs through F-type (funny) channels also known as HCN channels (Hyperpolarisation-activated, Cyclic Nucleotide* gated)
    - (* cAMP)
- F-type channels are not selective between K^+^ and Na^+^ but at -ve V~m~ Na^+^ entry is favoured (the current is therefore an inward depolarising Na^+^ current, i~f~)
- Clinical consideration: ivabradine is a drug that blocks F-type channels resulting in a reduced heart rate

#### Delayed rectifier voltage-activated K^+^ channels
- In addition to Na^+^ influx through F-type channels, delayed rectifier voltage-activated K^+^ channels (K~V~) inactivate which reduces outflow of K^+^ ions, i.e a reduced i~Kv~
- K~V~ inactivation results in reduced K^+^ outflow and hence a diminished polarising current 

#### Voltage-sensitive T-type (transient) Ca^2+ channels
- Latter stages (approximately final 1/3) of pacemaker potential includes opening of voltage-sensitive T-type Ca^2+^ channels (T, transient)
- T-type Ca^2+^ channels’ activation contributes to membrane depolarisation and subsequent activation of L-type Ca^2+^ channels at about -40mV
- Electrogenic 3Na^+^/Ca^2+^ exchanger contributes to pacemaker potential
    - i.e. 3 positive charges move in for every 2 that move out

#### Figure 1-2: membrane potential and relative membrane permeability
- Pacemaker potential: Na^+^ current through F-type channels and Ca^2+^ current through T-tyle Ca^2+^ channels and L-type Ca^2+^ channels plus diminished K^+^ current rhoguh K~V~ channels
- Action potential: Ca^2+^ current through L-type Ca^2+^ channels
- Repolarisation phase: closure of L-type Ca^2+^ channels plus activation of K^+^ current through K~V~ channels
    - K~V~ channels (delayed rectifier) activate slowly during action potential then inactivate slowly thereby contributing to next pacemaker potential

### Sympathetic effects
- Sympathetic neurotransmitter noradrenaline (and circulating adrenaline) acts on the beta-1 adrenoceptor to increase HR
- Mechanism: increased currents through F-type channels and L-type Ca^2+^ channels to accelerate pacemaker potential decay, AND increased current through KV channels to enhance repolarisation

### Parasympathetic effects
- Parasympathetic neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) acts on M~2~ receptor to decrease HR
- Mechanism: opposing effects on beta-1 adrenoceptor mediated outcomes, AND ACh decreases heart rate rapidly by activating K~ACh~ channels (hyperpolarising effect)
- Parasympathetic effects are rapid via K~ACh~ and degradation of ACh by cholinesterase 

#### Autonomic nervous system control of heart rate
- Pink line is sarcolemma, there are beta-1 receptors, muscarinic (M2) receptors and various channels

2. ![](https://i.imgur.com/6NoWUof.png =250x)
- AC is a membrane bound enzyme called adenylyl cyclase
    - AC is  activated by a stimulatory G protein (Gs) when beta-1 receptors are occupied
    - AC is inhibited by inhibitory G protein (Gi) when M2 is occupied
        - M2 occupation leads to K~ACh~ activation by Gi protein (actually, dissociation of Gi subunits generates subunits that inhibit AC while other subunits activate K~ACh~ which means that Gi dissociation has two effects)
- AC catalyses conversion of ATP into cAMP which, in turn, opens F-type channels which increases HR (remember  that   funny channels are also referred to as cyclic nucleotide activated  channels)
    - cAMP also activates a protein called protein kinase A  (PKA) which then phosphorylates and opens (i.e. increased open state probability) L-type Ca^2+^ channels and K~v~ channels thereby speeding up rising and falling phases of AP
- ACh binding to M2 inhibits AC thereby opposing the effects of beta-1 stimulation and decreases HR
    - AC activity therefore reflects a balance of competing effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves
- In addition, K~ACh~ are opened via M2 activation of inhibitory G protein

## Summary
- Magnitude, direction and timing of Na^+^, K^+^ and Ca^2+^ currents determine pacemaker potential and form of action potential
- Pacemaker potential arises due to inflow of Na^+^ through F-type channels, inflow of Ca^2+^ through T-type and L-type Ca^2+^ channels, and decreased outflow of K^+^ through delayed rectifier (K~V~) K^+^ channels
- Action potential rising (depolarisation) phase is due to inflow of Ca^2+^ through L-type Ca^2+^ channels
- Action potential repolarisation phase is caused by K^+^ outflow through delayed rectifier (K~V~) K^+^ channels and closure of the L-type Ca^2+^ channels 
- Autonomic modulation of ion channel activity modulates heart rate (HR)
- Increased sympathetic activity increases HR (decreased activity decreases HR)
- Increased parasympathetic activity decreases HR (decreased activity increases HR)

### Additional Notes
- Why are SA node action potentials smaller and slower-rising in comparison with ventricular cardiac myocytes?
    - Few fast Na^+^ channels
    - Ca^2+^ current through L-type Ca^2+^ channels depolarises membrane slowly in comparison with influence of voltage-gated Na^+^ channels in fast response cells
