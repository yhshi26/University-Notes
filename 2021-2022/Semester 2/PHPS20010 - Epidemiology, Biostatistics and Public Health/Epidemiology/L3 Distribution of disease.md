Knowing information on distribution of disease is important for adequate public/population health interventions

## Disease distribution looked at by: (3)
1. Person
2. Place
3. Time

### 1. Person characteristics
1. Demographic characteristics
    - Age/gender/ethnicity
2. Socioeconomic characteristics
    - Socioeconomic status/education level
    - Employment status/occupation
3. Lifestyle factors: e.g.
    - Smoking/alcohol consumption
    - Nutritional status
    - Other behavioural factors

#### Age-specific rates:
Age is most important characteristic of person to consider when describing occurence of any disease because variation by age is a lot greater than variation by any other personal attribute

Examples:
1. Infectious diseases occur more in children
2. Injuries/violence occur more in younger persons
3. Incidence of and mortality from chronic conditions occur more in older persons

These differences are described by age-specific rates

Age specific rates:
1. Number of cases/deaths in a defined group at a defined time
2. Population in that age group in/at same time

#### Gender-specific rate:
1. Number of cases in males/females in defined time period
2. Population of males/females in/at same time

#### Age-gender-specific rate:
1. Number of cases in males/females in defined age group, etc.
2. Population in that age-gender group in/at same time

### 2. Place characteristics
1. Area/regional/country of residence
2. Geographic differences in disease occurrence
3. Localised/spatial clustering of disease/events

For most part, concerned with international comparisons of rates

Note: 
1. Comparisons of rates (incidence/mortality) between countries/regions necessitates that individual countries adjust rates to account for difference in age structures which can account for differences in crude rates
2. Process to adjust rates to account for differences in age structures is "age standardisation" (need to adjust rates in each country to 1 standard population)

### 3. Time characteristics
Disease distribution over time can be influenced by:
1. Trends in disease occurence over time/changes in epidemiology of disease (e..g TB and other infectious diseases)
2. Changes in healthcare and other practices over time, e.g. 
    - Preventative measures/legislative changes
    - Implementation of screening processes/programs
    - Changes in treatment regimes/improved survival
    - Changes in reporting/documentation of events

Note:
1. Numbers by age group (left hand y-axis)
    - Presented as histograms/different colors for 2 time periods
2. Age-specific incidence ratse (right hand y-axis)
    - Presented as line graphs/different colors for 2 time periods
3. Difference in age-specific incidence rates graphs in 2 time periods
    - Possible explanation?
4. Age at which biggest change in age specific incidence rate occurs
    - Implications?

Conclusion: age-specific incidence rates are significantly more informative than crude incidence rates
