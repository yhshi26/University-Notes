## Background knowledge and foreground knowledge
Steps for evidence based practise: ask "do I need background or foreground knowledge?"
1. Background questions: relate to background information on disorder, test, treatment, etc.
2. Foreground questions: relate to specific patient case or population and are broken down into 4 components (PICO)
    - P = Patient or Population
    - I = Intervention or Exposure
    - C = Comparison intervention or exposure
    - O = Outcome
    - You can use PICO to pick apart a patient case and develop a relevant clinical foreground question such as: How effective is a CT scan compared to ultrasound in diagnosing suspected appendicitis in adult patients?

## Where to find evidence for clinical decision making? Or for population decision making?

## Steps for evidence based practice
### 1. Ask: types of questions

### 2. Acquire: evidence

## Critical appraisal of individual studies
- Objective
- POPULATION
- SETTING
- STUDY DESIGN: each design has its own features/statistical approaches and potential bias

- Systematic reviews: one question
- same PICO/S
- Many different studies conducted for the same questions
- Statically analysis: meta-analysis

- Aim: to increase sample size
