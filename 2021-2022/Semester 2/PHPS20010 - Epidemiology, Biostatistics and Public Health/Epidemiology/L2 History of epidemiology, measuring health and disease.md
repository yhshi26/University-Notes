## Epidemiology
Epidemiology is the study of health and disease among a population (not individuals) that yields results that aid in intervention and prevention
- "Epi": "among"
- "Demos": "the people"
- "Logos": "the study of"

### Epidemiology studies: (of health and disease among a population (not individuals))
- Descriptive epidemiology
    - Occurence and distribution
        - Disease occurence
        - Disease distribution
- Analytical epidemiology
    - Determinants
        - Determinants of disease

### Reasons to measure health/disease:
- To assess health of population
- To monitor changes in health of population (health increase/decline)
- To assess health needs of population/selected subgroups
- To organise health services to reflect changing epidemiology of disease
- To develop/revise health policy
- To evaluate cost-effectiveness of health programs/interventions
- To participate in international comparisons of health provision/cost
- To plan for future population health needs

### Indices to measure health:
1. Population (average) life expectancies
2. Self-reported health issues
3. Quality of life (QOL) measurements
4. Reductions in occurence of/death from disease
    - Changes in rates of disease/death

#### 1. Population (average) life expectancies
- Ancient times: lower → modern times: higher
- Men: lower → women: higher

#### 2. Self-reported health issues
- Disparity between low income → high income

#### 3. Quality of life (QOL) measurements
- Quality of life factors:
    - Physical health/capability functioning
    - Mental health/well being
    - Social functioning/general well being
- Different scales/scores systems to measure different dimensions of quality of life

#### 4. Changes in rates of disease/death
- Indices to measure rates of disease/death:
    1. Occurence/frequency
        - Incidence: number of new cases in defined time period (population at risk of developing disease in said time period)
            - Condition-specific (definition/dx criteria very important)
            - Population usually total/regional
            - Time period usually annual
            - Rate usually expressed per 1000/per 100,00 depending on frequency
        - Prevalence: number of existing cases at a point in time
            - Condition-specific (definition/dx criteria very important)
            - Population usually total/regional
            - Rate usually expressed as perent (per 100)/per 1000/per 100,000 depending on frequency
    2. Illness
        - Morbidity: rates of all illness at a point in time
    3. Deaths
        - Mortality (all-cause/cause-specific): number of deaths in defined time period (population "at risk" in said time period)
            - Usually expressed as annaul rate
            - Usually expressed per 1000/per 100,000

##### To derive disease rates must know:
- Data for numerator (i.e. "cases")
- Data for denominator (i.e. "population")

##### Sources of informaiton
1. On population "at risk" (denominator)
    - Could be entire population
    - Could be subgroup: e.g.
        - Specific age/gender/occupational group
        - Regional group
        - Special needs group
2. On disease "experience"/occurence (numerator)
    - National Cancer Registry
    - Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)
    - Hospital-based data (HIPE)
    - Mortality data (all-cause/cause-specific)
