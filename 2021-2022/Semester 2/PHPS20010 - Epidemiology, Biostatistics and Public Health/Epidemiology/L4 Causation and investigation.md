## Concept of disease occurence: (critical premise in epidemiology of disease)
1. Diseases/events don't occur randomly in a population
2. Diseases/events more likely to occur in some members of population than others because of risk factors that may not be distributed randomly in population
3. An important contribution of descriptive epidemiology is to identify factors that place some members at greater risk of a disease/event than others

## Concept of causation:
Causation is identifying a factor/factors responsible for occurrence of disease/event where causation cannot be established conclusively, arises concepts "risk" and "benefit" for disease/event from extraneous factors

Correlation is not causation (some diseases/events occur simultaneously without a link)

### Establishment/proof of causation for a given disease/event:
1. What is the case?
2. How cause is established?
3. Is it possible to prove cause?
4. Is there a single cause?
5. How to assess contribution fo several possible causes, alone/in combination, to disease occurrence?

### Theories of disease causation:
1. Supernatural theories
2. Hippocratic theory
3. Miasma
4. Theory of contagion
5. Germ theory (cause shown via Henle-Koch postulates)
    - Koch's postulates: established in 1884 to identify causal relationship between a microbe and a disease
        1. Microbe must be present in all cases of disease
        2. Microbe can be isolated from diseased host and grown in pure culture
        3. Microbe in pure culture must cause disease when inoculated in healthy subject
        4. Microbe must be reisolated from new host and shown to be same as that originally inoculated
6. Classic epidemiologic theory (epidemiologic triad)
    - Disease causation: simplest model proposed is epidemiologic triad (traditional model for infectious diseases)
        1. Triad consists of external agent, susceptible host and an environment that brings host and agent together
        2. Disease results from interaction between agent and host in an environment that supports transmission of agent from a source to host

        3. Opportunities for developing disease can be influenced by host behaviours, e.g. sexual practices, lifestyle choices, etc.
7. Multicausality and webs of causation (cause shown via Hill's postulates)

### Causal relationships:
- Causal pathway can be direct or indirect
    - Direct causation: A causes B without intermediate effects
    - Indirect causation: A causes B with intermediate effects
- Different categories of "cause": epidemiological triad model doesn't work for all non-infectious diseases other models attempt to account for multifactorial nature of causation in which a individual factors contributing to a disease are component factors
    - A combination of component causes resulting in a causal pathway is a sufficient cause
    - A component that appears in every pathway is a necessary cause
- Understanding factors in causation:
    - All factors contributing to a disease are component factors
    - Component factors may include intrinsic host factors, agent and environmental factors in agent-host-environment tried
    - A single component cause alone is rately sufficient to cause disease (host susceptibility and other factors play a role)

#### Component factors may be:
- Predisposing: age, sex, previous illnesses
- Enabling: low income, poor nutrition, bad housing or inadequate medical care
- Precipitating: exposure to a disease or noxious agent
- Reinforcing: repeated exposure or undue work or stress can aggravate an established disease/state

#### Necessary/sufficient cause:
- A necessary cause represents a factor that must be present for the effect to follow
- A sufficient cause represents a factor that will almost fully guarantee the effect
- Evidence of either a necessary or sufficient cause can be used as a basis for concluding that a relationship is causal
- Potential combinations of necessary/sufficient causes: e.g.
    1. Necessary and sufficient (Downs syndrome)
        - Example: Trisomy 21 and Down's syndrome
            - All individuals with 3 copies of 21st chromosome will have Downs syndrome therefore 3 copies of 21st chromosome is sufficient
            - All individuals with Downs syndrome must have 3 copies of 21st chromosome therefore trisomy 21 is necessary for Down's syndrome
    2. Necessary but insufficient (alcoholism)
        - Example: alcohol consumption and alcoholism
            - All individuals with alcoholism will have consumed alcohol therefore alcohol consumption is necessary for alcoholism
            - Not all individuals who consume alcohol will develop alcoholism therefore alcohol consumption is insufficient for alcoholism
    3. Unnecessary and insufficient (smoking/lung cancer)
        - Example: smoking and lung cancer
            - Some people with lung cancer are lifelong nonsmokers therefore smokign is unnecessary for lung cancer
            - Not all individuals who smoke develop lung cancer therefore smoking is insufficient to cause lung cancer
    4. Unnecessary but sufficient (judgement)
        - Example: conviction and judgement
            - Being convicted of crime is unnecessary (because you can be convicted/judged guilty as a result of confessing to a crime)
            - Being convicted of crime is sufficient for being judged guilty
        
## Analytical epidemiology
- Descriptive epidemiology can identify patterns among cases and in populations by time, place and person
- From these observations, epidemiologists develop hypotheses about causes of patterns and about factros that increase risk of disease
- We can use descriptive epidemiology to generate hypotheses but only rarely to test said hypotheses; for that, epidemiologists turn to analytical epidemiology

### Analytical epidemiology
- Investigating/understanding disease aetiology, i.e.:
    - Identifying associations of disease with possible aetiologic/risk factors
    - Refining and testing hypotheses regarding disease aetiology
- Investigating impact of preventative measures, e.g.:
    - Impact of multifaceted lifestyle interventions on cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, infectious disease, road fatalities
    - Impact of screening for chronic disease on morbidity, quality of life and mortality
- Investigating effect of novel therapeutic regimes, e.g.:
    - Impact of Rx/devices on mortality/survival/quality of life

#### Critical in analytical epidemiology is comparison:
- Comparison of groups of individuals:
    - With or without exposure to risk factors
    - With or without disease
    - Given/not given specific interventions

## Epidemiologic study designs
1. Descriptive studies (to generate hypotheses)
    - Case reports/case series
    - Cross-sectional studies (prevalence studies) measure exposure and disease at same time
    - Ecological studies (correlational studies) use group data rather than data on individuals
        - These data cannot be used to assess individual risk
        - To do that is to commit ecological fallacy
2. Analytical studies (to test hypotheses)
    - Experimental studies
        - Clinical trials
        - Field trials
        - Intervention trials
    - Observational trials
        - Case-control studies
        - Cohort studies
        - Cross-sectional (association) studies

## Bradford Hill criteria for causation:
1. Strength of association
    - Stronger association = less likely relationship due to chance
2. Consistency of observed association
    - Consistency of observed association in different studies, populations, places, circumstances
3. Specificity
    - Specificity of association between exposure, sites, types of disease
4. Temporality
    - Whether exposure of interest precedes outcome by a period of time consistent with any proposed biologic mechanism
5. Biologic gradient
    - Whether there's evidence of a gradient of risk associated with degree of exposure (dose-response relationship)
6. Biologic plausability
    - Whether there is a known/postulated mechanism by which exposure could reasonably alter risk of developing disease 
7. Coherence
    - Observed data should not conflict with known factors about natural history and biology of disease
8. Experiment
    - Strongest support for causation can be attained via controlled experiments (clinical trials, interventional studies, animal experiments)
9. Analogy
    - In some cases it can be reasonable to judge case-effecy relationships buy analogy 
        - e.g. effects of thalidomide and rubella suggest accepting similar evidence with another drug/another viral disease in pregnancy
