## Thoracic cage
- Consists of:
    - 12 thoracic vertebrae
    - 12 paired ribs
    - Manubrium, sternum, xiphoid
- Functions:
    - Forms skeleton of thoracic wall
    - Protects underlying viscera
    - Respiration

### Thoracic cage apertures
- Superior thoracic aperture: T1, 1st ribs, manubrium
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/cs1d1Da.png =250x)
- Inferior thoracic aperture: T12, inferior and medial margins of ribs 7-12, xiphoid
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/38j0N92.png =350x)

#### Important anatomical relations of superior thoracic aperture
- Brachial plexus passes laterally between anterior and posterior scalene muscles, above 1st thoracic rib
- Subclavian artery & vein also pass laterally above border of first rib
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/eJzKvB6.png =250x)

### Sternum
- Components: 
    - Manubrium
    - Sternum
    - Xiphoid process
- Articulations: 
    - Manubriosternal joint
    - Xiphisternal joint
    - Sternoclavicular joint
    - Sternochondral joints
- Transverse ridges in body of sternum are formed by sternebrae
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/slvSjIk.png =200x)

### Sternum ossification
- Sternum formed by 2 cartilaginous sternal plates that fuse in midline
- Cartilaginous sternum ossifies over time from ossification centres
- Junctions between ossifying portions form transverse ridges known as sternebrae
- Incomplete fusion leaves a sternal foramen or cleft
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/0aGJ8ET.png =350x)

#### Anomalies of sternal fusion
![](https://i.imgur.com/y7rQmCs.png =400x)

### Sternal angle
- Manubriosternal joint
    - Forms “Angle of Louis”/“Sternal Angle”
- Can be palpated easily on anterior thoracic wall in midline
- Paralaterally, costal cartilage of 2nd rib and 2nd rib space below can be palpated
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/bs6otOj.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/ID2eS5a.png =350x)

### Anterior thoracic cage joints
- Sternoclavicular joint
    - Atypical saddle shaped synovial joint (fibrocartilaginous disc exists between manubrium and clavicle)
- Manubriosternal joint
    - Secondary cartilaginous joint (symphysis)
- Xiphisternal joint
    - Primary cartilaginous joint (synchondrosis)
- 1st sternocostal joint
    - Primary cartilaginous joint (synchondrosis), moves with the sternum 
- 2nd – 7th sternocostal joints
    - 2nd synovial joint (2 cavities + 2 demifacets)
    - 3rd – 7th plane synovial joints, 1 cavity each
- Costochondral joints
    - Primary cartilaginous joints (synchondrosis)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/9IJerQW.png =250x)

### Clinical consideration: sternoclavicular joint dislocation
- Very stable joint, often clavicle will fracture rather than dislocate joint
- Anterior dislocation more common than posterior
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/c04ET26.png =250x)
- Posterior dislocations are an emergency
    - 30% are associated with life-threatening complications due to mediastinal injuries
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/vyaHKor.png =250x)
- Best handled by orthopaedics +/- vascular surgical teams
- If ipsilateral limb is pulseless, consider emergency reduction of joint

## Ribs
### True, false, and floating ribs
- True ribs are those that articulate directly anteriorly i.e. ribs 1-7
- False ribs are those that do not articulate directly with sternum i.e. ribs 8-10
    - (These articulate indirectly with sternum)
- Floating ribs are those that do not articulate with sternum i.e. ribs 11-12
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/tTLWEqa.png =250x)

### Typical vs. atypical ribs
- Typical ribs are ribs 3-9 which possess following features:
    1. Head
    2. Superior costovertebral joint facet on head
    3. Inferior costovertebral joint facet on head
    4. Interarticular crest between joint facets on head
    5. Neck
    6. Tubercle
    7. Costotransverse joint facet on tubercle
    8. Shaft (or body)
    9. Costal groove
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/LXTZ1jN.png =300x)
- Typical ribs articulate with vertebral column as shown
- Costovertebral joints
- Costotransverse joint
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/17yTX2q.png =200x)

#### Atypical rib: rib 1
- Atypical Features:
    - Shape is atypical: shortest and most curved rib, flat and broad
    - 2 groves across its superior surface for subclavian artery and vein
    - These grooves are separated by scalene tubercle
        - An equivalent tubercle is not present on other ribs
    - Single articular facet on its head, articulates with T1 vertebrae only
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/50TMjX0.png =250x)

#### Atypical rib: rib 2
- Atypical Features:
    - Rough area on its superior surface, tuberosity for serratus anterior
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Pf0S7ZC.png =250x)

#### Atypical rib: rib 10
- Atypical Features:
    - 1 articulation on head for articulation with T10 vertebra
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/PiR2HCc.png =250x)

#### Atypical rib: ribs 11-12
- Atypical Features:
    - These ribs are shorter than others
    - They have no neck or tubercle
    - 1 articular facet on head for articulation with T11/T12 respectively
    - No anterior articulation 
    - Anterior tip is tapered with rudimentary cartilage present on it
    - No tubercle for articulation with a transverse process
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/cxAZKi8.png =250x)

### Typical thoracic vertebrae
- Body
- Pedicles
- Laminae
- Vertebral foramen (aka spinal canal)
- Transverse process
- Spinous process
- Articulations with other vertebrae:
    - Superior and inferior articular facets
- Articulations with ribs:
    - These location and number of articulations varies depending on vertebral level
    - Image is that of a typical thoracic vertebra, which articulates with typical thoracic ribs
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/xN0clh9.png =300x)

### Atypical thoracic vertebrae
- T1: atypical because it has a complete costal facet for T1 rib rather than a demi-facet on its body
- T9: has a single costal demi-facet (rather than 2 like typical vertebrae) on its body/pedicle
- T10: has a single costal facet (rather than 2 demi-facets) on body/pedicle
- T11: has a single costal facet on body/pedicle, has no articular facet on transverse process
- T12: has a single costal facet on body/pedicle, has no articular facet on transverse process
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/48g8vJV.png =250x)

### Posterior thoracic cage joints
- Intervertebral joint
    - Intervertebral discs
    - Secondary cartilaginous joint: symphysis
- Zygapophyseal joint
    - Plane synovial joint on superior and inferior articular processes
- Costovertebral joints
    - Plane synovial joints
- Costotransverse joints 
    - Plane synovial joint
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/nLffdR1.png =250x)

## Clinical consideration
### Thoracic cage fracture
![](https://i.imgur.com/LwauDLu.png =350x)

### Flail chest
![](https://i.imgur.com/db5vnL6.png =350x)

### Cervical rib
- Additional cervical or lumbar ribs can occur
- Cervical ribs can cause thoracic outlet syndrome which is a syndrome caused by compression of neurovascular structures between 1st rib and extra cervical rib
- Possibility for subclavian steal syndrome to occur:
    - Usually, asymptomatic however...
    - During exertion, subclavian artery steals reverse-blood flow from vertebrobasilar arterial system
    - Results in vertebrobasilar insufficiency (inadequate perfusion of posterior brain regions)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/k8GL9iB.png =200x)
- T1 is usually most effected by cervical rib
    - May elicit neck symptoms (local effect) but also symptoms in distribution of C8 T1 etc
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/uickaMk.png =200x) 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/u6agQtH.png =450x)

## Rib movements
- Respiration: “bucket handle” and “pump handle” movements of ribs + sternum
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/oL0wDtG.png =200x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/xrvboVJ.png =200x)
- Ribs perform either pump handle movement or bucket handle movement depending on angle of their axis of rotation
