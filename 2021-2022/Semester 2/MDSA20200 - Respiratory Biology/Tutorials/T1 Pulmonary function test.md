## Case study 1
- John is a 63-year-old male (height:1.80m) who has come to his doctor because he is experiencing breathlessness on exercise. In recent years this has become progressively more severe so that now he finds that climbing the stairs at home leaves him so breathless that he has to rest at the top to recover. Although he now tries to avoid walking in the company of others, he knows that, when he does, his companions are compelled to walk at a much slower pace than normal. 
- John has had no previous medical problems and has spent his entire career working in a bank.  He has smoked 20 cigarettes per day since he was 16 years old, does not have any allergies and is not taking any medications or illegal drugs. Spirometric assessment shows the following:

|  | FEV~1~ (litres) | FVC (litres) | FEV~1~/FVC (%) |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Measured | 2.19 | 3.85 | 57 |
| Predicted | 3.42 | 4.39 | 76 |
| Lower limit | 2.91 | 3.78 | 69 |
| Upper limit | 4.26 | 5.39 | 88 |
 
1. Calculate the actual measured FEV1/FVC
2. Using the calculations in the PFT handbook, calculate the predicted value, lower and upper limits 

### Questions
- What is your assessment of pulmonary function in this individual?  How do the spirometric values compare to predicted values for this individual?
    - FEV1
    - FVC
    - FEV1/FVC
- If you think that this individual has lung disease, identify giving brief reasons, the broad category of disease indicated by the results.


## Case study 2
- Katherine is a 66-year-old woman (height:1.57m) who attends her doctor to complain of slowly increasing breathlessness over the last two years. This breathlessness is precipitated by exercise, but it has also troubled her while at rest, particularly when she is suffering from a “cold”. She has never smoked, has no other medical problems and is not taking any medications or illegal drugs. She works as a secretary ina hospital outpatient department. Spirometric assessment shows the following:

|  | FEV~1~ (litres) | FVC (litres) | FEV~1~/FVC (%) |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Measured | 1.04 | 1.43 | 73 |
| Predicted | 1.95 | 2.35 | 77 |
| Lower limit | 1.57 | 1.91 | 70 |
| Upper limit | 2.57 | 3.05 | 87 |

### Questions
- How do the spirometric values compare to predicted values for this individual?
    - FEV1
    - FVC
    - FEV1/FVC
- From the spirometric data, it is clear that this individual has impaired pulmonary function.  Identify, giving reasons the broad category of disease indicated by the results.
- Name one example of a disease within this broad category of lung diseases that may account for her complaint of breathlessness.

## Case study 3
- Jim, a 53-year-old man (height:1.62m) presents to a hospital outpatient clinic with a history of progressive dyspnoea over the past 18 months and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. Last summer he was ventilated in the intensive treatment unit for acute respiratory failure. At present he is managed on home oxygen and non-invasive ventilatory support. He has smoked 40 cigarettes per day for 30 years, having stopped smoking 1 year ago. Spirometric assessment shows the following:

|  | FEV~1~ (litres) | FVC (litres) | FEV~1~/FVC (%) |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Measured | 0.62 | 1.53 | 40.5 |
| Predicted | 2.94 | 3.61 | 77.7 |
| Lower limit | 2.43 | 3.00 | 70.5 |
| Upper limit | 3.78 | 4.61 | 89.5 |

### Questions
- How do the spirometric values compare to predicted values for this individual?
    - FEV1
    - FVC
    - FEV1/FVC
- From the spirometric data, it is clear that this individual has impaired pulmonary function.  What underlying condition could this patient have and why?

## Case study 4
- Martin is a 52-year-old farmer (height:1.70m) who comes to his doctor to discuss a problem with progressively increasing breathlessness while working on his farm. This spring the problem has become particularly bad but, on reflection, martin believes that it began approximately five years ago and has become progressively worse over that period of time. He is now unable to undertake heavy work around his farm, which his son has to do in his place. Martin is a non-smoker who has no other significant medical problems and is not taking any medications or illegal drugs. Spirometric assessment shows the following:

|  | FEV~1~ (litres) | FVC (litres) | FEV~1~/FVC (%) |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Measured | 3.09 | 3.99 | 77 |
| Predicted | 3.31 | 4.10 | 78 |
| Lower limit | 2.80 | 3.49 | 71 |
| Upper limit | 4.15 | 5.10 | 90 |

### Questions
- How do the spirometric values compare to predicted values for this individual?
    - FEV1
    - FVC
    - FEV1/FVC
- Give a potential cause for his breathlessness on the farm.

## Case study 5
- Mary is a 23-year-old woman (height:1.62m) who complains of shortness of breath while jogging. This is a recent problem, which began about six months ago; her breathlessness is so severe that it forces her to stop running. She has found that it then takes some hours to recover completely and on one occasion she was so alarmed that she attended the casualty department of her local hospital. At that time her FEV1 and FVC were 2.26 litres and 3.68 litres respectively.
- Mary has no other medical problems. She is a university student and is a life-long non-smoker. She is taking no medications and does not take any illegal drugs. On attending her doctor to discuss this problem, spirometric assessment shows the following:

|  | FEV~1~ (litres) | FVC (litres) | FEV~1~/FVC (%) |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Initial measured | 2.26 | 3.68 | 61 |
| Measured | 3.51 | 3.68 | 95 |
| Predicted | 3.22 | 3.69 | 85 |
| Lower limit | 2.84 | 3.26 | 78 |
| Upper limit | 3.84 | 4.40 | 95 |

### Questions
- What is your assessment of this individual’s pulmonary function at this time?
- Comment on the values recorded when she previously attended the casualty department. 
- Was this in any way indicative of impaired pulmonary function?
- What do you think might explain her complaint of shortness of breath while exercising?
