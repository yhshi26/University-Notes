## Lungs
- 2 lungs, large & spongy, right and left
    - Right lung 3 lobes, left lung 2 lobes
    - Lungs covered by pleural membrane
- Lie lateral to mediastinum within thoracic cavity
- Internally, airways continually divide, eventually forming many small alveoli
    - Pulmonary vasculature is in intimate contact with alveoli to facilitate gaseous exchange

### Features
- Right lung → 3 lobes
    - Superior, middle, inferior lobes
- Left lung → 2 lobes (heart takes up space)
    - Superior, inferior lobes, cardiac notch + lingula
- Anterior border (sharp), posterior border (blunt)
- Apices reach just above clavicles
- Costal surface, with rib impressions
- Medial surface aka mediastinal surface
- Base aka diaphragmatic surface

### Clinical considerations
#### Atelectasis 
- Collapsed lung
- Figure: atelectasis of left lung
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/QYkZri2.png =225x)

#### Anthracosis
- Carbon deposits accumulating, cannot be broken down or phagocytosed by immune cells in lung
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/IYVZHAi.png =300x)

#### Pneumoconiosis (occupational lung disease)
- Chronic inflammation causes fibrosis of lungs and respiratory disease
- Figure: lungs of coal mine worker, exposed to carbon dust while working over years
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/Y9UZOKe.png =300x)

### Respiratory tree divisions
- Carina → main bronchi → lobar bronchi → segmental bronchi → subsegmental bronchi → terminal bronchiole → respiratory bronchiole → alveoli

#### Main bronchi
- Right main bronchus is wider, shorter and more vertical than left
    - Aspirated foreign bodies are therefore more likely to occupy right main bronchus than left
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/dxVxieL.png =225x)

#### Alveolus
- Site of gaseous exchange
- 90% lined by squamous type 1 pneumocytes (gas exchange)
- 10% lined by type 2 alveolar cells (surfactant production)
- Thin epithelial layer between alveolar epithelium and capillary endothelium (diffusion)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/VWg3Y6u.png =350x)

## Pleurae
### Pleural membranes
- Visceral and parietal pleurae
- Pleural space
    - 10-20ml pleural fluid
- Costophrenic angle
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/IJuRE1H.png =350x)
- Negative intrathoracic pressure keeps lungs and visceral pleura pressed against parietal pleural and endothoracic fascia
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Iu9v09F.png =350x)

### Clinical consideration
#### Pneumothorax
- Usually following injury to chest wall (e.g. stab)
- Loss of negative intrathoracic pressure, air rushes into  pleural space
- Ipsilateral lung collapses (atelectasis) as no negative pressure to keep it inflated
- Diagnosis is clinical, history + examination (percuss chest wall, hyper-resonant!)
- Note: lateral margin of collapsed right lung 
- Address cause (close wound) and insert chest tube and connect to drain to restore negative intrathoracic pressure over time (suction can be applied if needed)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/KUsw5En.png =200x)

#### Pleural effusion
- Abnormal collection of fluid in right pleural space
- Obliteration of right costophrenic angle
- Pleural effusion exhibits a meniscus
- Meniscus flat as patient was standing when x-ray was taken
- What would happen if patient lay down?
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/yLiCTKG.png =200x)

#### Pneumonectomy
- Complete whiteout of left hemithorax
- Collection of fluid in cavity of left lung
- Reduced breath sounds on auscultation, dull on percussion
- Removal of a lung lobe = lobectomy
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/tD6SHDX.png =200x)

## Bornchopulmonary segments
- Each lung is divided into bronchopulmonary segments (18 total)
- Right lung = 10, left lung = 8
- Each BP segment is a separate respiratory unit
- Each BP segment has its own segmental bronchus and artery
- Segments are drained by pulmonary veins that lie in septae between segment
    - Pulmonary veins drain their adjacent segments

### Vascular supply of lungs and pleurae
- Lung is vascularised by 2 supplies: pulmonary and bronchial
- Bronchial:
    - Bronchial arteries:
        - 1 right: arises from aorta or a posterior intercostal artery (usually 3rd)
        - 2 left: arise from descending aorta
        - Supply carina to respiratory bronchioles where they anastomose
        - Perfuse visceral pleura
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/jlsYQ8f.png =250x)
    - Bronchial veins:
        - Superficial network: drains hilum and visceral pleura to azygos vein
        - Deep network: drain deep lung tissue to a pulmonary vein or directly to left atrium
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/7tHRgGI.png =250x)
- Pulmonary:
    - Pulmonary Arteries:
        - Left and right pulmonary arteries subdivide with bronchi eventually perfusing alveolar capillary beds with deoxygenated blood
        - Pulmonary arteries/arterioles do not supply bronchi
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/A6S2XcT.png =250x)
    - Pulmonary Veins:
        - Tributaries within intersegmental septae drain oxygenated blood from alveoli
        - These tributaries move towards hilum and continuously unite to form pulmonary venules/veins eventually forming 4 pulmonary veins that drain into left atrium (left and right, superior and inferior)

### Innervation of lungs
- Lungs innervated by:
    - Sympathetic
        - Bronchodilation, vasoconstriction, inhibition of secretomotor
    - Parasympathetic
        - Bronchoconstriction, vasodilation, secretomotor
    - Visceral afferent fibers
        - Reflexive or nociceptive
- Pulmonary plexuses are located anterior and posterior to lung roots
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/i12XkMs.png =250x)
- Parietal pleura receives sensory innervation from intercostal nerves (T1-T11, costal and diaphragmatic pleura) and phrenic nerve (C3-5, mediastinal and central pleura)
- Visceral pleura is innervated by autonomic nerves via pulmonary plexus
    - Sensitive to stretch, questionable sensitivity to pain
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/YTOYdaX.png =250x)

### Lymphatic drainage of lung and pleurae
- Pulmonary lymphatic plexuses freely communicate with each other
- Subpleural lymphatic plexus
    - Bronchopulmonary (hilar) nodes
- Deep bronchopulmonary lymphatic plexus 
    - Intrinsic pulmonary nodes 
    - Bronchopulmonary (hilar) nodes
