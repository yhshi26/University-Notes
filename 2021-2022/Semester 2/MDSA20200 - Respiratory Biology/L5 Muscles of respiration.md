## Diaphragm
### Form
- Primary muscle of respiration, separates thoracic and abdominal cavities
- Dome shaped musculotendinous structure (skeletal muscle)
- Muscular fibers attached from inferior thoracic aperture to a central tendon
- 2 domes (right and left)
    - Level of domes vary depending on phase of respiration
    - Right dome higher than left... why? (presence of liver)
    - At end of expiration (view from anteriorly)
        - Right dome - 4th intercostal space
        - Left dome - 5th rib/intercostal space

- Central tendon
    - Left leaflet
    - Central leaflet
    - Right leaflet
- Central tendon derived from septum transversarium like fibrous pericardium
    - Thus, they are fused (pericardiophrenic ligaments)

### Diaphragm action
#### Respiratory action
- Inspiration
    - Contraction of diaphragm pulls domes and central tendon inferiorly thus increasing intrathoracic volume
    - As intrathoracic volume increases, intrathoracic pressure decreases
    - Negative pressure within thorax with respect to atmospheric pressure draws air in
- Expiration
    - Relaxation of diaphragm causes muscle to recoil to its resting expiratory position, thus reducing intrathoracic volume
    - As intrathoracic volume is decreased, intrathoracic pressure is increased with respect to atmospheric pressure, which expels air
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/f9koGnu.png =350x)

#### Other action
- Defecation, micturition, parturition
    - Contraction of diaphragm combined with abdominal wall contraction increases intraabdominal pressure
- Anti-reflux
    - Contraction of right crus sling (which occurs during diaphragmatic contraction, tightens sphincter around oesophagus and helps to prevent reflux of gastric contents back up to esophagus)
- Increases venous return
    - Contraction of diaphragm also pulls open widely aperture for IVC thus assisting venous return to right atrium
- Protects vertebral column during heavy lifting
    - (Dead lift for example) contraction of diaphragm and abdominal muscles converts abdominal region into a rigid cylinder, thus protecting the back, then legs perform lifting

### Apertures 
- Main Apertures:
    - T8: vena cava (8 letters)
    - T10: esophagus (10 letters)
    - T12: aortic hiatus (12 letters)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/1pODAbJ.png =200x)
- Other apertures:
    - Left amd right phrenic nerves
    - Sympathetic trunks
    - Splanchnic nerves
    - 7th – 11th intercostal nerves
    - Subcostal Nerves (T12 nerves)
    - Superior epigastric vessels
    - Hemiazygos vein
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/bpJdAOL.png =250x)

### Vascular supply
- Arterial supply from 3 sources
- Superior Surface:
    1. From superior phrenic branches of thoracic aorta
    2. From pericardiophrenic/musculophrenic branches of internal thoracic artery
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/ivsnfAN.png =300x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/LhjWHRf.png =300x)
- Inferior Surface:
    3. From inferior phrenic branches of abdominal aorta
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/OeQUZQa.png =325x)

### Venous drainage
- Margins
    - Anteriorly, anterior intercostal branches of musculophrenic vein
    - Posteriorly, posterior intercostal branches of azygos (right) and hemiazygos (left) veins
- Central tendon
    - Superiorly, superior phrenic veins to azygos/hemiazygos systems and pericardiophrenic veins to internal thoracic veins
    - Inferiorly, inferior phrenic veins to abdominal IVC
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Xb4OWRf.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/dMX6TVn.png =250x)

### Innervation
- Sensory
    - Phrenic nerves provide ipsilateral sensory supply to most of diaphragm
    - Intercostal nerves also contribute to sensory and proprioceptive supply of periphery of diaphragm
- Motor
    - Ipsilateral supply from left and right phrenic nerves
    - Emerge from C3, C4, C5 (mostly C4)
    - "C3, 4, 5 keeps the diaphragm alive"

## Clinical considerations
### Shoulder tip pain: refer from diaphragm
![](https://i.imgur.com/EoW7zYY.png =450x)

### Hiatus hernia
- Main symptom, dyspepsia
- Note: stratified squamous epithelium of esophagus can be exposed to acid produced by stomach’s columnar epithelium of stomach
- Left untreated, this will lead to gradual dysplasia and metaplasia of esophageal epithelium and esophageal cancer
- Treatment, conservative, pharmacological or surgical
- Fundoplication...
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/bFgydvh.png =250x)

### Hernia of Bochdalek
- Failure of left pleuroperitoneal membrane to close in-utero 
- Results in defect in posterior attachment of diaphragm
- Migration of abdominal viscera into thoracic cavity
- Unilateral in 97% cases and 75-90% on left side
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/eh60Deg.png =175x)

## Intercostal muscles
- 3 layers of muscle between ribs
    - External intercostal muscles
    - Internal intercostal muscles
    - Innermost group of muscles
- Note orientation of fibers: important functionally!
- Clinically important space lies between internal and innermost intercostals... intercostal space
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/BKcEcak.png =250x)

### External intercostal muscles
- Span from tubercles of rib 1-11 to cartilages of ribs 2-12
- Attachments: inferior border of rib to superior border of rib immediately below
- Do not enclose thorax anteromedially
- Terminate as anterior intercostal membranes
- Innervated by intercostal nerves
- Action: elevate ribs, increasing intrathoracic volume during forced inspiration
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ddyKU4q.png =250x)
> Remember: pockets (put fingers in pockets, direction they're pointing is direction fibers of external inner costal muscles run for inspiration) 

### Internal intercostal 
- Span from sternum between costal cartilages of true ribs and from outer costal cartilages of false ribs
- Attachments: costal groove of rib to superior border of rib immediately below
- Do not enclose thorax posteriorly
- Terminate as posterior intercostal membranes
- Innervated by intercostal nerves
- Actions: 
    - Interosseous part depress ribs, decreasing intrathoracic volume during forced expiration
    - Interchondral part elevates ribs, increasing intrathoracic volume during forced inspiration
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/f1tXyXu.png =250x)
> Remember: tits (put hands on chest, direction they're pointing is direction fibers of innermost intercostal muscles run)

### Innermost intercostal group
- 3 muscles in this group
    1. Transversus Thoracis (anteriorly)
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/CQQRWbL.png =150x)
    2. Innermost intercostal muscles (laterally)
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/i2WS8fB.png =150x)
    3. Subcostalis (posteriorly)
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/iXun1h8.png =150x)

#### Transversus thoracis
- Lies between thoracic wall and parietal pleura
- Attachments: posterior surface of inferior sternum to internal surface of costal cartilages 2-6
- Action: very little action; weakly depresses ribs, reducing intrathoracic volume during forced expiration
- Innervated by intercostal nerves T2-T6 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/3W1CQSn.png =225x)

#### Innermost intercostals
- Lateral thoracic wall, deep to internal intercostals
- Attachments: costal groove of rib to superior border of rib immediately below
- Fibers run in same direction as internal intercostals
    - Continuous with transversus thoracis anteriorly and subcostalis posteriorly
- Innervated by intercostal nerves
- Actions: 
    - Interosseous part depress ribs, decreasing intrathoracic volume during forced expiration
    - Interchondral part elevates the ribs, increasing intrathoracic volume during forced inspiration
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/SGVFSL8.png =225x)

#### Subcostalis
- Located inferior portion of thoracic wall
- Consists of thin slips of muscle, coursing from internal surface of rib angles in paravertebral gutter to 2nd or 3rd rib below
- Action: depresses ribs, decreasing intrathoracic volume during forced expiration
- Innervated by intercostal nerves
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/UTlvdJb.png =225x)

#### Extra muscle: levator costarum
- Origin: transverse processes of C7-T11
- Insertion: subjacent ribs between tubercle and angle (may pass to next rib or rib after it)
- Action: elevates ribs
- Innervation: posterior rami of C8-T11 spinal nerves
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/XJcI3mv.png =225x)

### Relative position of muscles
- Summary slide for relative positions of:
    - External intercostal muscles
    - Anterior intercostal membrane
    - Internal intercostal muscles
    - Posterior intercostal membrane
    - Innermost intercostal muscles
    - Transversus thoracis
    - Internal thoracic artery
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/zhDgRYA.png =350x)

## Neurovascular supply
- Neurovascular bundle runs in costal groove
- Collateral neurovascular bundles are given off at angle of the rib
    - Collaterals run above superior border of rib below
- Venous: posterior intercostal veins anastomose with anterior intercostal veins
- Arterial: posterior intercostal arteries anastomose with anterior intercostal arteries
- Nerves: intercostal nerves (see next slides)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ofUvlQd.png =350x)

### Intercostal nerves
- T1 – T11 spinal nerve anterior divisions are called intercostal nerves
- T12 spinal nerve anterior division is called subcostal nerve
- T3-T6 intercostal nerves are typical, rest are atypical
- Note: ganglia of sympathetic trunk resides in paravertebral gutter
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/GLHMAgp.png =225x)

### Typical spinal nerve (T3-T6)

## Clinical considerations
### Triangle of safety
- Indicates an anatomical region where risk of inadvertently damaging important anatomical structures is minimised when introducing a chest tube or performing pleurocentesis
- Why is triangle relatively safe?
    - Too high to hit diaphragm, entering abdominal cavity (remember inverted J shape of diaphragm) and piercing abdominal viscera
    - Safest place to introduce needle or tube is directly above rib below because collateral neurovascular bundle is smaller than main neurovascular bundle in costal groove.

## Accessory muscles of respiration
- These muscles are recruited to aid respiration during vigorous exercise or during respiratory distress
    1. Scalene muscles
    2. Sternocleidomastoids
    3. Sternohyoid (SHY)
    4. Sternothyroid (STHY)
    5. Pectoralis major
    6. Pectoralis minor
    7. Serratus anterior
    8. Serratus posterior (superior and inferior)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/XSm0qRf.png =250x)

### Muscles of anterior chest wall
- When arms are fixed in certain positions, pectoralis major and minor can be recruited to assist with rib elevation and thus aid respiration
- With scapulae fixed, serratus anterior can assist with rib elevation during inspiration
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/LfYKhks.png =250x)

### Muscles of posterior chest wall
- Resides in intermediate layer of back muscles
- Serratus posterior
    - Superior

        - Insertion: ribs 2-5
        - Action: elevates ribs during forced inspiration
        - Innervation: intercostal nerves
    - Inferior
        - Origin: T11-L3 spinous processes
        - Insertion: ribs 9-12
        - Action: depresses ribs during forced expiration
        - Innervation: intercostal nerves
- Innervation:
