###### tags: `MDSA20200 - Respiratory Biology`

## Learning objectives
- Identify and describe the primary structures in the organisation of the respiratory system
- Identify the main histological aspects of each component of the conducting system and gas exchange region
- To relate structure to function of the conducting airways and gas exchange region

## Respiratory system structure and function
- Structure of respiratory system closely relates to its function
- Structure is arrangement of inter-related elements: e.g. building blocks such as tissue types:
    - Epithelium: number of cell layers, lines body surfaces
    - Connective tissue: collagen and elastin
    - Muscle: smooth muscle and skeletal muscle
    - Nervous: receive stimuli from internal and external environments, integrates signals
- Function is operation of each individual component as part of structure

### Respiratory system functions
- Airflow: movement of air in and out of site of gaseous exchange
- Gas exchange and transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide:
    - Provide oxygen: air → lungs → blood → tissues
    - Eliminate carbon dioxide: tissues → blood → lungs → air
- Conditions air: warm, filter and humidify air 
- Acid-base regulation: by controlling carbon dioxide, regulate blood pH
- Temperature regulation
- Metabolism: removal of noradrenaline, prostaglandins, 5-HT
- Hormonal activity: angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in lungs
- Immune protection: defend against microbes, toxic chemicals and foreign matter
- Maintain airway patency
- Production of sound/speech
- Olfactory sensation (sense of smell)

#### Respiratory system organisation
- Inspiration is movement of air from external environment into alveoli
- Expiration is movement of air from alveoli to external environment

## Histology of respiratory tract
- Epithelium:
    - Respiratory System is covered by epithelium which varies down tract
    - Initially epithelial cells are pseudostratified columnar ciliated, then cuboidal then squamous
- Glands and goblet cells:
    - Upper respiratory tract has abundant glands, but they are absent from bronchioles onwards
    - Abundant goblet cells decrease in number until bronchioles
- Cartilage:
    - Cartilage is found throughout respiratory tract until small bronchi
    - In trachea cartilage is found in C-shaped rings; in bronchi as plates
- Smooth muscle:
    - Smooth muscle in trachea joins the C-shaped cartilage
    - Smooth muscle is found throughout bronchi and bronchioles which it surrounds completely
- Elastic tissue:
    - Elastic tissue is found in bronchi and bronchioles

### Histology of functional divisions
- Conducting Zone: (dead space region) 
    - Nasal cavity → terminal bronchioles
    - Get air in
    - Warm moisten air
    - Clean air
- Respiratory Zone: 
    - Respiratory bronchioles → alveoli
    - Gas exchange mechanism

### Upper respiratory tract

#### Nose and nasal cavity
- Air enters nasal cavity via nostrils (nares)
- Nose is subdivided into 2 nasal cavities (NC) separated by nasal septum (NS)
- Vestibule lined with hairs to trap large particles and mucus to trap debris in air
- Nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses (PS) are line by respiratory mucosa principally involved in filtering, humidifying and adjusting temperature of inspired air
- Turbinate bones (TB) project into nasal cavity and increase surface area which air flows over
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/u8wD8hS.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/1Dk273B.png =250x)

#### Nasal mucosa 
- Mucosa of nasal cavity is lined with pseudostratified ciliated columnar respiratory epithelium (RE)
- Contains mucin-secreting goblet cells
- Supported by lamina propria rich in blood vessels (V) and serous (S) and Mucous (M) glands, secretions of which trap small particles
- Mucous layer propelled to pharynx by cilia (muco-ciliary escalator) for digestion
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/g7UfgZg.png =250x)

#### Pharynx
- Passageway that connects nasal and oral cavity 
- Shared by digestive and respiratory systems
- Divided into 3 sections by location:
    - Nasopharynx: superior portion above soft palate 
    - Oropharynx: back of mouth cavity down to epiglottis
    - Hypopharynx: between hyoid bone and esophagus
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/n35q0jU.png =250x)
- Nasopharynx: respiratory epithelium and lamina propria contains seromucous glands 
- Lymphoid tissue (L) (Waldeyer ring of lymphoid tissue) adenoid
- Oropharynx non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/iLIUbI9.png =250x)

#### Larynx
- Larynx is continuous with trachea
- Superior end is attached to hyoid bone that lies below epiglottis
- Consists of 9 laryngeal cartilages (hyaline and elastic) connected by muscle and ligaments
- Maintains open passageway for air movement
- Prevents swallowed materials from entering trachea
- Sound production

#### Trachea
- Extends from larynx to midline of thorax where it divides into right and left main bronchi (~10cm long)
- Function: warm, clean and conduct air
- Distinct layers:
    - Mucosa (M)
        - Respiratory epithelium
            - Pseudostratified ciliated tall columnar cells
            - Goblet cells
            - Serous Cells 
            - Basal cells (lie close to basement membrane)
            - Brush Cells
        - Basement membrane
        - Lamina Propria
            - Highly vascular connective tissue and elastic fibres
    - Submucosa (SM)
        - Mixed seromucous glands
    - C-shaped hyaline cartilage rings (C )
        - ~16-20 pieces to provide flexible support to airway
        - Bands of smooth muscle (trachealis muscle) join free ends of posterior rings (T)
        - Contraction reduces diameter e.g. during coughing
    - Adventitia: connective tissue which tracheal adjacent structures
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/MMX2h6P.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/wMocOHY.png =350x)

#### Primary bronchus
- Right primary bronchus is shorter, wider and more vertical
- Basic structure is similar to trachea however:
    - Respiratory epithelium is less tall with fewer goblet cells (GC)
    - Lamina propria (LP) has more elastin fibres (El) and is separated from submucosa (SM) with smooth muscle (M) which becomes more prominent in distal bronchi
    - Submucosa has less seromucinous glands
    - Cartliage is in flattened interconnected plates rather than distinct rings
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/265FTtg.png =350x)

#### Bronchioles
- Airway <1mm diameter
- No cartilage or submucosal glands
- Ciliated columnar epithelium 
- Few goblet cells
- Bronchioles have a smooth muscle coats surrounded by fibroelastic connective tissue
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/0nsoT5D.png =250x)
- In larger bronchioles epithelium is simple columnar ciliated, with occasional goblet cells 
- In smaller bronchioles epithelium change to simple cuboidal, with no goblet cells 
- In terminal and respiratory bronchioles goblet cells are replaced with Club cells (formerly known as Clara cells)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Av6VLp2.png =350x)

##### Bronchioles: major points to remember
- Diameter 1 mm or less
    - Major characteristics
        - Bronchioles lack cartilage
        - Smooth muscle layer is relatively thicker (relative to lumen size).
        - Non-ciliated Clara cells are present in epithelium
        - Epithelium is simple columnar to simple cuboidal with fewer cilia
        - No glands in submucosa

- Region of gas exchange in lung (between air and blood;)
    - Respiratory bronchioles
    - Alveolar ducts
    - Alveolar sacs
    - Alveoli
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/DaeZ5FG.png =250x)
- Respiratory bronchioles:
    - Single alveoli in walls
    - Devoid of goblet cells
    - Ciliated cuboidal epithelium cells
    - Non-ciliated Club (Clara cells) cells: 
        - Produce a component of surfactant
        - Act as stem cells (able to divide)
        - Contain enzyme systems to detoxify
- Respiratory bronchioles divide into several alveolar ducts (AD) which have numbers of alveoli
- They appear as small aggregations of smooth muscle cells, collagen and elastic fibres
- Alveolar ducts end in an alveolar sac (AS) which in turns opens to several alveoli
- Each alveolus consists of a pocket open at one side
- Lined by flattened epithelial cells pneumocytes
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/4aE1kUd.png =250x)

#### Alveoli
- ~300 million air sacs
- Surface area (60-80m^2^)
- Each alveolus is 1 cell thick (250μm diameter)
- Surrounded by capillaries
- Alveolar pores (of Kohn)
    - Allow some movement of air between adjacent alveoli 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/SdpBXzY.png =350x)
- Alveolar wall consists of
    - Surface epithelium
    - Supporting tissue
    - Blood vessels
- Large squamous Type I pneumocytes (alveolar lining cells) P1
    - Large flattened cells 
    - 95% surface area of alveoli
    - Facilitate gas exchange
    - Maintain ion/fluid balance within alveoli
    - Communicate with type II cells
- Type II pneumocytes P2
    - Produce and secrete pulmonary surfactant (decreased surface tension prevents alveoli collapse)
    - ~3-5% of alveolar surface area
    - Expression of immunomodulatory proteins
    - Transepithelial movement of water 
    - Regeneration of alveolar epithelium after injury
- Capillaries (C ) with red blood cells (RBC)
- Alveolar macrophage (M)

### Pleura
- Formed of 2 layers
    - Parietal pleura forms internal lining of chest cavity
    - Visceral pleura: externally coats lungs
- Normally in contact but contain a small amount of serous fluid to lubricate movement during breathing
