## Learning objectives

## Emergence of respiratory tree from foregut
### Formation of respiratory diverticulum
- Respiratory diverticulum is a ventral outpouching of foregut endoderm
- Endoderm forms epithelial lining of larynx, trachea, bronchial tree, alveoli
- Splanchnic mesoderm forms cartilage, muscle, connective tissue, pleura

### Separation of trachea and esophagus
- Respiratory diverticulum appears at week 4 with 2 lung buds
- Over 1-week, longitudinal tracheoesophageal ridges form, move closer together, and meet in midline forming tracheosophageal septum, separating primitive trachea and oesophagus
- Outgrowth of primitive trachea occurs as does septation between primitive trachea anteriorly and primitive oesophagus posteriorly
- Bronchial buds form during this process

### Tracheoesophageal fistula
- Sometimes just called TEFs
- Caused by failure of tracheoesophageal septum to fully partition the primordial respiratory tract from primordial esophagus
- 1/3000 births
- ~84-90% occur in upper esophagus
    - Upper esophagus ends in blind pouch (atresia)
    - Lower esophagus forms a fistula with trachea
- Surgically managed with esophagoesophagostomy
- Note: some TEFs result in polyhydraminos
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/nH5YL7Z.png =350x)

### Polyhydraminos 
- Polyhydraminos = excess amniotic fluid
- Can occur due to tracheoesophageal fistula
- Mechanism:
    - Normal, water passes from mother to fetus through placenta/umbilical cord
    - Amniotic fluid expelled from fetal lungs and urinary system into amniotic sac
    - Amniotic fluid resorbed from amniotic sac by fetal
    - Swallowed amniotic fluid is absorbed by fetal digestive tract and can pass back to mother via umbilical cord/placenta, prevents excess buildup
    - In some TEFs, amniotic fluid swalled by fetus cannot pas to stomach and intestine for absorption
    - Without a resorption pathway, excess amniotic fluid accumulates

## Development of laryngeal structures
### Pharyngeal arches
- Form from 4th week, travel ventrally and medially to meet its counterpart in midline
- Form rise to head and neck structures
- Each pharyngeal arch consists of a core of mesenchyme, inner lining of endoderm and outer lining of ectoderm
- Each arch has its own nerve supply, wherever musculature of a nerve migrates to during development, it carries its nerve supply with it
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/pxyb3J2.png =350x)

### Development of larynx and laryngeal orifice 
- Laryngeal orifice changes shape as laryngeal cartilages form (week 6-12) from 4th-6th pharyngeal arch mesenchyme
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/BacWmhm.png =450x)
- Note: rapid proliferation of laryngeal epithelium (weeks 7-10) causes temporary occlusion of larynx
- Patency of larynx is then restored by vacuolization/recanalization usually complete by week 10
- Failure of this process can leave a residual Laryngeal Web
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/AVir37T.png =250x)
#### Vacuolization/recanalization
- Vacuolization and recanalization produces a pair of lateral recesses, laryngeal ventricles
- Ventricles are bound by folds of tissue that differentiate into:
    - Vocal folds (true vocal folds) 
    - Vestibular folds (false vocal folds)
- Failure of vacuolisation/recanalization causes laryngeal web
- Figure: coronal section through larynx, looking from posterior to anterior

#### Clinical consideration: laryngeal web
- 1/10000 births
- ~75% at glottic level
- Varying severity
- Presentation can be varied:
    - Respiratory distress
    - Stridor
    - Hoarse or weak voice
    - Frequent upper respiratory infections
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/khO0EwE.png =350x)

## Development of trachea
### Week 0-10
- As endodermal tube grows caudally, it differentiates and becomes respiratory epithelium
- Mesenchymal cells surround tube and ultimately form:
    - Cartilage
    - Connective tissue
    - Smooth muscle of its walls
- By week 8, mesenchymal rudiments of ~16-20 C-shaped cartilaginous rings are present.
- In following 2 weeks these rudiments form cartilages, beginning cranially and extending caudally
- At same time, connective tissue forms between cartilages and trachealis forms posteriorly
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/byhcVYm.png =250x)

### Week 12-20
- By week 12, mucosal glands arise in endoderm and develop in cranial to caudal direction
- By ~20th week, all major microscopic features of trachea are present
- Fetal trachea is comparatively short to the adult
    - Even in infant it is short (note epiglottis-soft palate overlap)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/dfM80MG.png =250x)

## Development of bronchi and lungs
### Bronchi, lungs and alveoli
- During its separation from foregut and esophagus, lung bud (endoderm) goes on to form bronchial buds and is surrounded by mesoderm
    - At beginning of 5th week, each bronchial bud enlarges to form left and right main bronchi
        - Right main bronchus then forms 3 lobar bronchi and left 2: reflecting lobes of right and left lungs respectively
    - Growth continues caudally and laterally in consuming space in pericardioperitoneal canals
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/bkLnvu3.png =450x)
- Pleuroperitoneal folds appear at beginning of week 5
    - These folds fuse anteriorly with septum transversum in week 7
        - This seperates thoracic and peritoneal cavities
    - As growth proceeds, endoderm continues to be surrounded by mesoderm
        - This mesoderm becomes pleura with visceral in direct contact with endoderm and parietal in contact with inner walls of primitive thoracic cavity
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/myHTqlz.png =250x)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/FyHQxst.png =250x)

### Pleurae
- Pleura form from mesoderm
- As bronchial tree grows and expands caudally and laterally from endoderm, it remains lined by mesoderm
- Mesoderm in direct contact with bronchial tree becomes visceral pleura
- Mesoderm in direct contact with body cavity becomes parietal pleura
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/lKVUEJD.png =350x)

### Lung development stages

### Clinical consideration: primary ciliary dyskinesia
- Mucous produced by respiratory mucosa is normally swept outwards by epithelial cilia
- Can be expelled via coughing etc. (removes pathogens)
- In PCD, abnormal structure/function of cilia undermines this process
    - Chronic nasal congestion
    - Recurring pneumonia
    - Chronic middle ear infections
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/CBRoXD1.png =250x)

## Development of diaphragm
- Pleuroperitoneal folds close pericardioperitoneal canals by growing anteriorly and medially
- Pleuroperitoneal folds fuse with septum transversarum and mesentery of esophagu
- Myoblasts from body wall also penetrate membranes forming  peripheral muscular part of diaphragm
- Initially, primitive diaphragm is at level of cervical somites and nerve components of 3rd – 5th  cervical spinal cord segments grow into septum
- Rapid growth of dorsal part of embryo (vertebral column) causes relative position of primitive diaphragm to migrate caudally
- During 4th week, septum transversarum lies opposite cervical but by 6th week it is at level of thoracic somites
- By 12th week, some dorsal bands of diaphragm originate at level of upper lumbar vertebrae (crura!)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/7gmaOXf.png =350x)

## Clinical considerations
### Congenital diaphragmatic hernia
- Caused by failure of formation of diaphragm
    - Most usually a failure of pleuroperitoneal fold to close pericardioperitoneal folds
- 1/2000 – 1/2500 live births
    - Male:female 2:1 , left:right 5:1
- Abdominal viscera migrate into thoracic cavity: pulmonary hypoplasia
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/qY4uj8p.png =250x)

### Pulmonary hypoplasia
- Pulmonary hypoplasia = small underdeveloped lungs
- Note migration of liver and small bowel (and likely spleen!) into thoracic left thoracic cavity
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/BUJD4ER.png =175x)

#### Another mechanism causing pulmonary hypoplasia
- Pulmonary hypoplasia can occur due to oligohydramnios
- (Note: oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios are opposites)
- Oligohydraminos = inadequate amniotic fluid
- Mechanism:
    - Kidney pathology
    - Less urine produced
    - Less amniotic fluid produced
    - Fetus squashed
    - Reduced intrathoracic cavity size
    - Smaller lungs
