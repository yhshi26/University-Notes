### Cartilages
#### Thyroid cartilage
- Right and left laminae are fused anteromedially forming laryngeal prominence
- Facets for articulation with cricoid cartilage are on medial side of tip of inferior horns
- Thyroid angle male (90°) vs. female (120°) 
- Oblique line serves as attachment point for two strap muscles (sternothyroid, thyrohyoid) and thyropharyngeus
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/RSEd8vr.png =250x)

#### Cricoid cartilage
- Signet ring shaped
- Arch anteriorly, laminae posteriorly
- Laterally, articular facets for inferior horns of thyroid cartilage
- Superiorly, articular facets for arytenoid cartillages
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/NA5nT3h.png =250x)

#### Artenoid cartilages
- Arytenoid: 2 pyramid-shaped small cartilages that articulate with the cricoid cartilage
    - Apex → articular facets for corniculate cartilages
    - Vocal Process → attachment for vocal cords
    - Muscular Process → attachment for posterior  and lateral cricoarytenoid muscles
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Yq79Tp6.png =300x)

#### Corniculate cartilages
- Small horn-like cartilages (elastic)
- Serve to extend arytenoid cartilages medially and posteriorly
- Sometimes fused with arytenoid cartilage
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/NceKKGN.png =300x)

#### Epiglottic cartilage
- Note: sagittal section through thyroid cartilage to show epiglottic cartilage
- Leaf-shaped elastic cartilage
- Stalk attaches to posterior aspect of thyroid cartilage, joined by thyroepiglottic ligament
- Laterally joined to arytenoid cartilages via quadrangular ligament (shown later)
- Superiorly joined to hyoid bone via hyo-epiglottic ligament (shown later)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/WzAbG0L.png =150x)

#### Cuneiform cartilages
- Small paired elastic cartilages that reside bilaterally in aryepiglottic ligament
- Superior and anterior to corniculates
- Small club like tubercles visible through overlying aryepiglottic folds
    - Cuneiforms form the lateral aspect of the laryngeal inlet
    - Corniculates form the posterior
    - Epiglottic cartilage forms the anterior

### Internal structures
#### Figure 3: mid-sagittal section through laryngeal skeleton
- Note: Many of ligaments and their overlying mucosal membranes have been removed for clarity 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/S94WwGx.png =250x)

#### Mid-sagittal sections through laryngeal skeleton: 
1. Quadrangular membrane:
    - Attached to lateral border of epiglottis, arytenoid/corniculate cartilages, thyroid cartilage
    - Free posterosuperior margin is called aryepiglottic ligament
    - Free inferior margin is called vestibular ligament
2. Conus elasticus:
    - This is lateral portion of cricothyroid ligament
    - Conus elasticus blends with inferior of vocal ligament
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/3VyBHW3.png =250x)
3. Mucosal membrane:
    - Overlies all the internal structures, cartilages and ligaments/membranes
    - Note: “ligament” + mucosa = “fold”
        - When aryepiglottic ligament is covered by mucosal membrane, it is called aryepiglottic fold
        - When vestibular ligament is covered by mucosal membrane, it is called vestibular fold (also called false vocal fold); protective function, don't produce sound
        - When vocal ligament is covered by mucosal membrane, it is called vocal fold (also called true vocal fold); function, sound production
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/rdmn7Do.png =250x)

#### Coronal section through larynx: looking from posterior to anterior
- Laryngeal vestibule is laryngeal inlet and vestibular folds; air passes through here during inspiration/expiration
- Ventricle is lateral extension of space between vestibular fold and vocal fold
- Saccule is the end of a blind pouch and ascends from anterior 1/3 of the ventricle; it is a space between vestibular folds and inner thyroid lamina
- Saccule has abundance of mucous glands, lubricate + protect vocal folds

## Laryngeal muscles
### Movements of vocal folds

| Muscle | Action | Diagram | 
| ------ | ------ | ------- | 
| Posterior cricoarytenoid | Abduction |![](https://i.imgur.com/wBpqB79.png =100x)|
| Lateral cricoarytenoid | Adduction |![](https://i.imgur.com/FyRlTuF.png =100x)|
| Interarytenoid | Adduction |![](https://i.imgur.com/Cc4a71P.png =100x)|
| Cricothyroid | Tension |![](https://i.imgur.com/JEvmrhW.png =100x)|
| Thyroarytenoid and vocalis | Relaxation |![](https://i.imgur.com/mpgUP3U.png =100x)|

### Muscles that move epiglottic cartilage
1. Thyroepiglotticus:
    - Posterior surface of thyroid cartilage → anterior/superior surface of epiglottis
    - Opens aditus
2. Aryepiglotticus:
    - Arytenoid cartillages → epiglottic margin
    - Closes aditus
- Innervation: inferior Laryngeal Nerve (CNX)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/sRmuw58.png =250x)

### Intrinsic laryngeal muscles
1. Thyroarytenoid:
    - Internal surface of thyroid cartilage → arytenoid cartilage
    - Pulls arytenoids closer to thyroid cartilage, reduces tension on vocal ligaments
2. Lateral cricoarytenoid:
    - Lateral surface of internal cricoid cartilage → arytenoid cartilage muscular process
    - Turns arytenoids on cricoid cartilage, bringing vocal process closer together in midline thus adducting vocal ligaments
3. Posterior cricoarytenoid:
    - Posterolateral surface of cricoid → muscular process of arytenoid
    - Turns arytenoids on cricoid to move vocal processes away from midline thus abducting vocal ligaments
4. Interaytenoid (transverse):
    - Arytenoid → arytenoid
    - Pulls arytenoids closer together, thus adducting vocal ligaments
- Innervation: inferior Laryngeal Nerve (CNX)

#### Figure 4: superior view
![](https://i.imgur.com/wnUhr3F.png =250x)

#### Figure 5: posterior view
- Oblique interaytenoids included in this image
- They also pull arytenoids closer together and thus adduct vocal ligaments
- They also act as a sphincter for laryngeal inlet
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/FvwrPnI.png =250x)

#### Figure 6: lateral view
- Note positions of previously mentioned intrinsic muscles
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/gDWIPkM.png =250x)

### Intrinsic laryngeal muscles
1. Cricothyroid muscle:
    - Anterolateral surface of arch of cricoid cartilage → inferior margin of thyroid cartilage
    - Pulls cricoid arch and thyroid cartilage closer together anteriorly; this in turn angles arytenoids posteriorly, which increases tension on vocal ligaments
- Innervation: external branch of superior laryngeal nerve (CNX)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/5gtOepc.png =200x)

## Neurovascular supply
### Vascular supply
- Arterial supply:
    - Superior laryngeal artery:
        - Branch of superior thyroid artery
        - Accompanies internal branch of superior laryngeal artery
    - Inferior laryngeal artery:
        - Branch of inferior thyroid artery
        - Accompanies inferior laryngeal nerve
- Venous Drainage:
    - Superior laryngeal vein:
        - Follows course of superior laryngeal artery
        - Drains into superior thyroid vein
    - Inferior laryngeal vein (not shown):
        - Drains into inferior thyroid vein or venous plexus on anterior trachea
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/WfAgdJO.png =450x)

### Innervation
- Superior and inferior laryngeal nerves are branches of vagus nerve (CNX)
- SLN arises from inferior vagal ganglion in carotid triangle
- ILN is continuation of recurrent laryngeal nerve
- Superior laryngeal nerve:
    - Internal branch proves sensory and autonomic innervation
    - External branch provides motor innervation to cricothyroid muscle
- Inferior laryngeal nerve:
    - Provides motor innervation to all laryngeal muscles except cricothyroid
    - Provides sensory innervation to infraglottic mucosa

#### Left vagal nerve and branches to larynx
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/2FLgvCg.png =250x)

#### Vagal nerve asymmetry
- Left RLN loops around arch of aorta
- Right RLN loops around subclavian artery
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/h2A7d76.png =250x)

### Lymphatics
- Above vocal folds, lympathics accompany superior laryngeal artery, through thyrohyoid membrane to superior deep cervical nodes
- Below vocal folds, lymphatics drain to pretracheal or paratracheal nodes and subsequently to inferior deep cervical nodes
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/CfobS3U.png =225x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/nrjUqEi.png =275x)

## Trachea
- Continuous with Larynx above (~C6) and carina below (T4/5)
- Carina is division of trachea into right and left main bronchi which serve as a conduit for air to pass to/from right and left lungs during respiration
- Trachea contains ~16 C-shaped hyaline cartilaginous rings that maintain patency of airway; posteriorly enclosed by trachealis muscle
- Lined by respiratory mucosa (goblet cells, cilia)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/GoroIEO.png =250x)

## Clinical aspects
### Laryngoscopy
- Technique to visualise structures within larynx
- Direct: with neck in extended position, curved blade laryngoscope used to lift tongue anteriorly; operator can see directly through mouth to vocal folds
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/Spp2kEm.png =200x)
- Indirect: nasendoscope passes posteriorly through nasal cavity, posterior to soft palate, through laryngopharynx and into laryngeal vestibule
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/yce3DQD.png =200x)

### Vocal fold paralysis
- Presents as sudden onset dysphonia (hoarseness)
- Laryngoscopy can help indicate problem
- Note position of each vocal fold during respiration/phonation
- Remember muscular actions and innervations 

#### Figure 7: view of rima glottidis and vocal folds
![](https://i.imgur.com/OmYzDho.png =350x)

### Emergency cricothyroidotomy
- Upper airway obstruction: foreign body sitting above vocal folds or occlusion for some other reason above vocal folds; air is prevented from passing to and from lungs
- Cricothyroidotomy = emergency procedure to manage an upper airway obstruction
- Incision made through median cricothyroid ligament to bypass obstruction
- Tube inserted through aperture in cricothyroid membrane, balloon cuff inflated, airway secured
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/VxoN73B.png =250x)

### Laryngocele
- Abnormal dilatation of laryngeal saccule 
    - Internal (i.e. remain within larynx)
    - External (i.e. protrude through thyrohyoid membrane)
    - Mixed
- Excision with external approach
