- Overview: In this practical, students will be introduced to the technique of using spirometry for recording respiratory variables. Students will analyse a previously prepared (due to COVID) spirometry chart to derive respiratory variables. They will compare the person’s lung volumes and capacities with and without an increase in airway resistance (simulated lung disease). Students will complete the self-assessment -components of the practical document in preparation of their PFT tutorial.
- Introduction:  Lung diseases including asthma and cigarette-related lung disease commonly alter the volumes that can be contained within, and expired from, the lungs. Such diseases frequently increase the resistance to gas flow offered by the conducting airways.  These abnormalities cause breathing to become difficult and impair gas exchange in individuals suffering from these conditions.  Identification of the presence of disease usingpulmonary function tests forms an important step in the diagnosis of lung disease. Furthermore, repeated measurements over time allow assessment of disease progression and response to therapy.  
- Obstructive lung diseases: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are the 2 typical examples of obstructive lung disease. The hallmark of obstructive lung disease is difficulty expelling air out of the lungs due to progressive airway narrowing. Airway narrowing can occur due to bronchoconstriction, mucus, and inflammation of the airways, which leads to increased airway resistance and airflow limitation. 
- Restrictive lung disease: Pulmonary fibrosis is a typical example of a restrictive lung disease, which is characterised by the inability of the lungs to fully expand due stiffening and thickening and deposition of fibrotic tissue in the lungs. Restriction of airflow is due to poor compliance. 
- Pulmonary Function Tests: Pulmonary function tests are important and commonly used test to assess lung function using airflow and lung volumes measurements. They facilitate the diagnosis of lung disease and are important for monitoring disease progression and response to treatment. They may also be used to assess the risk of respiratory complications that might occur during and following surgery. 

## Key measures obstained using spirometry and peak flow meters
- Forced vital capacity (FVC), the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled with a maximally forced effort from a maximum inspiration, i.e., vital capacity performed with a maximally forced expiratory effort, expressed in litres
- FEV1 (Forced Expired Volume in one second): volume expired in the first second of maximal expiration after a maximal inspiration.
- FEV1/FVC: FEV1 expressed as a percentage of the FVC, gives a clinically useful index of airflow limitation. A FEV1/FVC value less than 70% suggests airflow limitation.
- Peak expiratory flow (PEF), the maximum flow rate that can be achieved during a brief forced expiration from total lung capacity (TLC). 
- Maximum mid-expiratory flow (MMEF) (sometimes abbreviated as FEF25–75%): forced expiratory flow over the middle half of the FVC; the average flow from the point at which 25% of the FVC has been exhaled to the point at which 75% of the FVC has been exhaled.

- FVC is the maximum volume expired at the end of the exhalation.  Note that the record should show a clear plateau indicating that all airflow has ceased at the time this measurement. 
- FEV1 is the volume expired at the end of 1 second. Please note that in practice three recordings are made to ensure reproducibility. 
- It is the largest of the 3 values for FEV1 and FVC that are taken even if they are taken in separate trials.

- Note the value for the FVC, which is ascribed a value of 100%. 
- On the record identify the points on the curve where 25% (Volume 1, V1) and 75% (Volume 2, V2) of the total FVC were expired. 
- Note the time points on the x axis corresponding to these values i.e. Time 1 (t1)and Time 2 (t2) respectively.  The FEF25%-75% is calculated as follows: FEF25%-75% = (V2 – V1)/(t2 – t1)
    - The value is the mean flow rate during the period when the middle 50% of the FVC is being expired and is expressed in litres/second.

### Peak Flow Meter
- The peak flow meter is also used to assess peak expiratory flow (the volume of air forcefully expelled from the lungs in one quick exhalation) and is a reliable indicator of ventilation adequacy as well as airflow obstruction. Asthma is the most common condition that affects peak flow. However, other conditions such as COPD that cause airway obstruction also affect PEF. Peak expiratory flow is a simple and easy and thus commonly used to assess asthma severity. 
- Peak flow is also an important measure of the effectiveness of treatment with a bronchodilator. People with asthma may monitor their PEF daily to monitor disease progression.

### What are normal lung function values? 
- Pulmonary lung function varies with age, sex, standing height*. Thus, in clinical practice prediction equations are used to determine whether a lung function assessment falls within the ‘normal’ range. The test results are typically compared to the predicted values, and the lower limits of normal (LLN) for the individual being tested.  A link to an online calculator for prediction equations can be found here: http://gli-calculator.ersnet.org/index.html, which are most currently endorsed equations by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) based on the work of the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI)1. 
- Spirometry values are reported as the volumes and flows at body temperature (37 C) and ambient atmospheric pressure at the time of recording.

## Learning objectives
- Understand how lung function is assessed using spirometry with the video demonstration
- Understand the meaning of FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC and PEF
- Determine from the previously prepared spirometry chart: FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC and FEF25-75 values
- To be able to use these values during diagnostic evaluations or in the assessment of disease and therapeutic response

## Self-directed learning assessment 
1. From your chart provided below of a FVC from a normal manoeuvre (black trace) and one while simulating airway obstruction with an added resistance (red trace), determine the following:

    | Respiratory parameter | Unit | Normal breathing | Obstructed breathing |
    | --------------------- | ---- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
    | Forced vital capacity | | | |
    | Forced expiratory volume (FEV1) | | | |
    | FEV1/FVC ratio | | | | 
    | FEF25%-75% | | | |

2. Compared to normal breathing, how are FEV1 values affected by simulating airway obstruction? 
    - Give a reason for this?
    - What are the other key observations from these values? 

3. Compared to obstructive airway disease, restrictive does not have increased resistance to airflow rather the lungs are prevented from fully expanding because of restrictions in the lung tissue, pleurae, muscles, ribs or sternum.Based on this reduced capacity, what do you think would happen FVC, FEV1 and FEV1/FVC?
    - FVC:
    - FEV1:
    - FEV1/FVC:

4. 2 patients have been sent for pulmonary function assessments on the basis of complaining of shortness of breath. Based on their acquired PFT values (Trial) compared to their predicted equations for their normal range make an assessment on whether you think they have normal lung function, obstructive or restrictive lung disease.
    - A male age 23, height 1.95m has complained of shortness of breath

    | Respiratory parameter | Trial 1 | Predicted values |
    | --------------------- | ------- | ---------------- | 
    | Forced vital capacity | 4.4 litres | 5.7 -7.2 litres | 
    | Forced expiratory volume (FEV1) | 3.7 litres | 4.7- 6.1 litres | 
    | FEV1/FVC ratio | 84% | 68.7 – 87.7% | 

    - A female age 19, height 1.64m has complained of shortness of breath
    
    | Respiratory parameter | Trial 1 | Predicted values |
    | --------------------- | ------- | ---------------- | 
    | Forced vital capacity | 4.4 litres | 3.5 – 4.6 litres | 
    | Forced expiratory volume (FEV1) | 2.7 litres | 3.0- 4.0 litres | 
    | FEV1/FVC ratio | 61% | 68.7 – 87.7% | 
    
> Note: Lung function prediction equations have historically been adjusted based on ethnicity and is still often seen in clinical practice today. However, increasing evidence indicates that this practice is not scientifically well-founded. 
> 
> A recent report of a large, multi-ethnic, population-based cohort study2 found no evidence that currently recommended race/ethnic-based reference equations for the percent-predicted FEV1 and FVC improved prediction of chronic lower respiratory disease or mortality compared to race/ethnic-neutral equations, and that the inclusion of race/ethnicity in contemporary clinical practice of spirometry should be revised. Differences formerly attributed to race/ethnicity were probably the result of differences in nutrition, housing conditions, healthcare and diseases of early childhood.  For these reasons we have not used such equations here.
