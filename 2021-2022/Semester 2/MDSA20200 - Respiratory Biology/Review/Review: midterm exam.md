- Inflammation of the palatine tonsils
- Can be viral or bacterial:
    - Bacterial: white spots appear on tonsils
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/nmF1nYp.png =150x)
    - Viral: white spots can appear on tonsils, but less common
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/M7SHlfa.png =150x)

#### Chronic recurrent tonsilitis
- Tonsillectomy = removal of palatine tonsils
    - Often performed to manage chronic recurrent tonsilitis
- Note: tonsils have very rich arterial blood supply
    - Therefore, when operating on tonsils to perform sonillectomy it is important to be careful to watch for post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage (within the next day or so)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/FFYidHR.png =250x)

### Tongue

#### Figure 3: mid-sagittal section through laryngeal skeleton
- Note: Many of ligaments and their overlying mucosal membranes have been removed for clarity 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/S94WwGx.png =250x)

#### Mid-sagittal sections through laryngeal skeleton: 
1. Quadrangular membrane:
    - Attached to lateral border of epiglottis, arytenoid/corniculate cartilages, thyroid cartilage
    - Free posterosuperior margin is called aryepiglottic ligament
    - Free inferior margin is called vestibular ligament
2. Conus elasticus:
    - This is lateral portion of cricothyroid ligament
    - Conus elasticus blends with inferior of vocal ligament
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/3VyBHW3.png =250x)
3. Mucosal membrane:
    - Overlies all the internal structures, cartilages and ligaments/membranes
    - Note: “ligament” + mucosa = “fold”
        - When aryepiglottic ligament is covered by mucosal membrane, it is called aryepiglottic fold
        - When vestibular ligament is covered by mucosal membrane, it is called vestibular fold (also called false vocal fold); protective function, don't produce sound
        - When vocal ligament is covered by mucosal membrane, it is called vocal fold (also called true vocal fold); function, sound production
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/rdmn7Do.png =250x)

#### Coronal section through larynx: looking from posterior to anterior
- Laryngeal vestibule is laryngeal inlet and vestibular folds; air passes through here during inspiration/expiration
- Ventricle is lateral extension of space between vestibular fold and vocal fold
- Saccule is the end of a blind pouch and ascends from anterior 1/3 of the ventricle; it is a space between vestibular folds and inner thyroid lamina
- Saccule has abundance of mucous glands, lubricate + protect vocal folds

| ------ | ------ | ------- | 
| Posterior cricoarytenoid | Abduction |![](https://i.imgur.com/wBpqB79.png =100x)|
| Lateral cricoarytenoid | Adduction |![](https://i.imgur.com/FyRlTuF.png =100x)|
| Interarytenoid | Adduction |![](https://i.imgur.com/Cc4a71P.png =100x)|
| Cricothyroid | Tension |![](https://i.imgur.com/JEvmrhW.png =100x)|
| Thyroarytenoid and vocalis | Relaxation |![](https://i.imgur.com/mpgUP3U.png =100x)|

### Muscles that move epiglottic cartilage
1. Thyroepiglotticus:
    - Posterior surface of thyroid cartilage → anterior/superior surface of epiglottis
    - Opens aditus
2. Aryepiglotticus:
    - Arytenoid cartillages → epiglottic margin
    - Closes aditus
- Innervation: inferior Laryngeal Nerve (CNX)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/sRmuw58.png =250x)

### Intrinsic laryngeal muscles
1. Thyroarytenoid:
    - Internal surface of thyroid cartilage → arytenoid cartilage
    - Pulls arytenoids closer to thyroid cartilage, reduces tension on vocal ligaments
2. Lateral cricoarytenoid:
    - Lateral surface of internal cricoid cartilage → arytenoid cartilage muscular process
    - Turns arytenoids on cricoid cartilage, bringing vocal process closer together in midline thus adducting vocal ligaments
3. Posterior cricoarytenoid:
    - Posterolateral surface of cricoid → muscular process of arytenoid
    - Turns arytenoids on cricoid to move vocal processes away from midline thus abducting vocal ligaments
4. Interaytenoid (transverse):
    - Arytenoid → arytenoid
    - Pulls arytenoids closer together, thus adducting vocal ligaments
- Innervation: inferior Laryngeal Nerve (CNX)

#### Figure 4: superior view
![](https://i.imgur.com/wnUhr3F.png =250x)

#### Figure 5: posterior view
- Oblique interaytenoids included in this image
- They also pull arytenoids closer together and thus adduct vocal ligaments
- They also act as a sphincter for laryngeal inlet
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/FvwrPnI.png =250x)

#### Figure 6: lateral view
- Note positions of previously mentioned intrinsic muscles
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/gDWIPkM.png =250x)

### Intrinsic laryngeal muscles
1. Cricothyroid muscle:
    - Anterolateral surface of arch of cricoid cartilage → inferior margin of thyroid cartilage
    - Pulls cricoid arch and thyroid cartilage closer together anteriorly; this in turn angles arytenoids posteriorly, which increases tension on vocal ligaments
- Innervation: external branch of superior laryngeal nerve (CNX)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/5gtOepc.png =200x)

## Neurovascular supply
### Vascular supply
- Arterial supply:
    - Superior laryngeal artery:
        - Branch of superior thyroid artery
        - Accompanies internal branch of superior laryngeal artery
    - Inferior laryngeal artery:
        - Branch of inferior thyroid artery
        - Accompanies inferior laryngeal nerve
- Venous Drainage:
    - Superior laryngeal vein:
        - Follows course of superior laryngeal artery
        - Drains into superior thyroid vein
    - Inferior laryngeal vein (not shown):
        - Drains into inferior thyroid vein or venous plexus on anterior trachea
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/WfAgdJO.png =450x)

### Innervation
- Superior and inferior laryngeal nerves are branches of vagus nerve (CNX)
- SLN arises from inferior vagal ganglion in carotid triangle
- ILN is continuation of recurrent laryngeal nerve
- Superior laryngeal nerve:
    - Internal branch proves sensory and autonomic innervation
    - External branch provides motor innervation to cricothyroid muscle
- Inferior laryngeal nerve:
    - Provides motor innervation to all laryngeal muscles except cricothyroid
    - Provides sensory innervation to infraglottic mucosa

#### Vagal nerve asymmetry
- Left RLN loops around arch of aorta
- Right RLN loops around subclavian artery
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/h2A7d76.png =250x)

### Lymphatics
- Above vocal folds, lympathics accompany superior laryngeal artery, through thyrohyoid membrane to superior deep cervical nodes
- Below vocal folds, lymphatics drain to pretracheal or paratracheal nodes and subsequently to inferior deep cervical nodes
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/CfobS3U.png =225x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/nrjUqEi.png =275x)

## Trachea
- Continuous with Larynx above (~C6) and carina below (T4/5)
- Carina is division of trachea into right and left main bronchi which serve as a conduit for air to pass to/from right and left lungs during respiration
- Trachea contains ~16 C-shaped hyaline cartilaginous rings that maintain patency of airway; posteriorly enclosed by trachealis muscle
- Lined by respiratory mucosa (goblet cells, cilia)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/GoroIEO.png =250x)

## Clinical aspects
### Laryngoscopy
- Technique to visualise structures within larynx
- Direct: with neck in extended position, curved blade laryngoscope used to lift tongue anteriorly; operator can see directly through mouth to vocal folds

## Thoracic cage
- Consists of:
    - 12 thoracic vertebrae
    - 12 paired ribs
    - Manubrium, sternum, xiphoid
- Functions:
    - Forms skeleton of thoracic wall
    - Protects underlying viscera
    - Respiration
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/pUOcnra.png =350x)

### Thoracic cage apertures
- Superior thoracic aperture: T1, 1st ribs, manubrium
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/cs1d1Da.png =250x)
- Inferior thoracic aperture: T12, inferior and medial margins of ribs 7-12, xiphoid
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/38j0N92.png =350x)

#### Important anatomical relations of superior thoracic aperture
- Brachial plexus passes laterally between anterior and posterior scalene muscles, above 1st thoracic rib
- Subclavian artery & vein also pass laterally above border of first rib
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/eJzKvB6.png =250x)

### Sternum
- Components: 
    - Manubrium
    - Sternum
    - Xiphoid process
- Articulations: 
    - Manubriosternal joint
    - Xiphisternal joint
    - Sternoclavicular joint
    - Sternochondral joints
- Transverse ridges in body of sternum are formed by sternebrae
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/slvSjIk.png =200x)

### Sternum ossification
- Sternum formed by 2 cartilaginous sternal plates that fuse in midline
- Cartilaginous sternum ossifies over time from ossification centres
- Junctions between ossifying portions form transverse ridges known as sternebrae
- Incomplete fusion leaves a sternal foramen or cleft
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/0aGJ8ET.png =350x)

#### Anomalies of sternal fusion
![](https://i.imgur.com/y7rQmCs.png =400x)

### Sternal angle
- Manubriosternal joint
    - Forms “Angle of Louis”/“Sternal Angle”
- Can be palpated easily on anterior thoracic wall in midline
- Paralaterally, costal cartilage of 2nd rib and 2nd rib space below can be palpated
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/bs6otOj.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/ID2eS5a.png =350x)

### Anterior thoracic cage joints
- Sternoclavicular joint
    - Atypical saddle shaped synovial joint (fibrocartilaginous disc exists between manubrium and clavicle)
- Manubriosternal joint
    - Secondary cartilaginous joint (symphysis)
- Xiphisternal joint
    - Primary cartilaginous joint (synchondrosis)

    - Primary cartilaginous joints (synchondrosis)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/9IJerQW.png =250x)

### Clinical consideration: sternoclavicular joint dislocation
- Very stable joint, often clavicle will fracture rather than dislocate joint
- Anterior dislocation more common than posterior
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/c04ET26.png =250x)
- Posterior dislocations are an emergency
    - 30% are associated with life-threatening complications due to mediastinal injuries
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/vyaHKor.png =250x)
- Best handled by orthopaedics +/- vascular surgical teams
- If ipsilateral limb is pulseless, consider emergency reduction of joint
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4900050/

## Ribs
### True, false, and floating ribs
- True ribs are those that articulate directly anteriorly i.e. ribs 1-7
- False ribs are those that do not articulate directly with sternum i.e. ribs 8-10

- ![](https://i.imgur.com/17yTX2q.png =200x)

#### Atypical rib: rib 1
- Atypical Features:
    - Shape is atypical: shortest and most curved rib, flat and broad
    - 2 groves across its superior surface for subclavian artery and vein
    - These grooves are separated by scalene tubercle
        - An equivalent tubercle is not present on other ribs
    - Single articular facet on its head, articulates with T1 vertebrae only
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/50TMjX0.png =250x)

#### Atypical rib: rib 2
- Atypical Features:
    - Rough area on its superior surface, tuberosity for serratus anterior

### Typical thoracic vertebrae
- Body
- Pedicles
- Laminae
- Vertebral foramen (aka spinal canal)
- Transverse process
- Spinous process
- Articulations with other vertebrae:
    - Superior and inferior articular facets
- Articulations with ribs:
    - These location and number of articulations varies depending on vertebral level
    - Image is that of a typical thoracic vertebra, which articulates with typical thoracic ribs
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/xN0clh9.png =300x)

### Atypical thoracic vertebrae
- T1: atypical because it has a complete costal facet for T1 rib rather than a demi-facet on its body
- T9: has a single costal demi-facet (rather than 2 like typical vertebrae) on its body/pedicle
- T10: has a single costal facet (rather than 2 demi-facets) on body/pedicle
- T11: has a single costal facet on body/pedicle, has no articular facet on transverse process
- T12: has a single costal facet on body/pedicle, has no articular facet on transverse process

## Clinical consideration
### Thoracic cage fracture
![](https://i.imgur.com/LwauDLu.png =350x)

### Flail chest
![](https://i.imgur.com/db5vnL6.png =350x)

### Cervical rib
- Additional cervical or lumbar ribs can occur
- Cervical ribs can cause thoracic outlet syndrome which is a syndrome caused by compression of neurovascular structures between 1st rib and extra cervical rib
- Possibility for subclavian steal syndrome to occur:
    - Usually, asymptomatic however...
    - During exertion, subclavian artery steals reverse-blood flow from vertebrobasilar arterial system
    - Results in vertebrobasilar insufficiency (inadequate perfusion of posterior brain regions)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/k8GL9iB.png =200x)
- T1 is usually most effected by cervical rib
    - May elicit neck symptoms (local effect) but also symptoms in distribution of C8 T1 etc
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/uickaMk.png =200x) 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/u6agQtH.png =450x)

## Rib movements
- Respiration: “bucket handle” and “pump handle” movements of ribs + sternum
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/oL0wDtG.png =200x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/xrvboVJ.png =200x)
- Ribs perform either pump handle movement or bucket handle movement depending on angle of their axis of rotation

    - Safety triangle
    - Pleurocentesis and chest drain insertion
    - Flail chest

## Diaphragm
### Form
- Primary muscle of respiration, separates thoracic and abdominal cavities
- Dome shaped musculotendinous structure (skeletal muscle)
- Muscular fibers attached from inferior thoracic aperture to a central tendon
- 2 domes (right and left)
    - Level of domes vary depending on phase of respiration
    - Right dome higher than left... why? (presence of liver)
    - At end of expiration (view from anteriorly)
        - Right dome - 4th intercostal space
        - Left dome - 5th rib/intercostal space
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/PyzrCeB.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/372mqaC.png =200x)
- Central tendon
    - Left leaflet
    - Central leaflet
    - Right leaflet
- Central tendon derived from septum transversarium like fibrous pericardium
    - Thus, they are fused (pericardiophrenic ligaments)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/cLLs2aQ.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/yqwJEPJ.png =150x)

### Specific attachments of diaphragm
![](https://i.imgur.com/eUnKOJO.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/lQiR6oP.png =250x)

### Diaphragm action
#### Respiratory action
- Inspiration
    - Contraction of diaphragm pulls domes and central tendon inferiorly thus increasing intrathoracic volume
    - As intrathoracic volume increases, intrathoracic pressure decreases
    - Negative pressure within thorax with respect to atmospheric pressure draws air in
- Expiration
    - Relaxation of diaphragm causes muscle to recoil to its resting expiratory position, thus reducing intrathoracic volume
    - As intrathoracic volume is decreased, intrathoracic pressure is increased with respect to atmospheric pressure, which expels air
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/f9koGnu.png =350x)

#### Other action
- Defecation, micturition, parturition
    - Contraction of diaphragm combined with abdominal wall contraction increases intraabdominal pressure
- Anti-reflux
    - Contraction of right crus sling (which occurs during diaphragmatic contraction, tightens sphincter around oesophagus and helps to prevent reflux of gastric contents back up to esophagus)
- Increases venous return
    - Contraction of diaphragm also pulls open widely aperture for IVC thus assisting venous return to right atrium
- Protects vertebral column during heavy lifting
    - (Dead lift for example) contraction of diaphragm and abdominal muscles converts abdominal region into a rigid cylinder, thus protecting the back, then legs perform lifting

### Apertures 
- Main Apertures:
    - T8: vena cava (8 letters)
    - T10: esophagus (10 letters)
    - T12: aortic hiatus (12 letters)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/1pODAbJ.png =200x)
- Other apertures:
    - Left amd right phrenic nerves
    - Sympathetic trunks
    - Splanchnic nerves
    - 7th – 11th intercostal nerves
    - Subcostal Nerves (T12 nerves)
    - Superior epigastric vessels
    - Hemiazygos vein
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/bpJdAOL.png =250x)

### Vascular supply
- Arterial supply from 3 sources
- Superior Surface:
    1. From superior phrenic branches of thoracic aorta
    2. From pericardiophrenic/musculophrenic branches of internal thoracic artery
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/ivsnfAN.png =300x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/LhjWHRf.png =300x)
- Inferior Surface:
    3. From inferior phrenic branches of abdominal aorta
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/OeQUZQa.png =325x)

### Venous drainage
- Margins
    - Anteriorly, anterior intercostal branches of musculophrenic vein
    - Posteriorly, posterior intercostal branches of azygos (right) and hemiazygos (left) veins
- Central tendon
    - Superiorly, superior phrenic veins to azygos/hemiazygos systems and pericardiophrenic veins to internal thoracic veins
    - Inferiorly, inferior phrenic veins to abdominal IVC
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Xb4OWRf.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/dMX6TVn.png =250x)

### Innervation
- Sensory
    - Phrenic nerves provide ipsilateral sensory supply to most of diaphragm
    - Intercostal nerves also contribute to sensory and proprioceptive supply of periphery of diaphragm
- Motor
    - Ipsilateral supply from left and right phrenic nerves
    - Emerge from C3, C4, C5 (mostly C4)
    - "C3, 4, 5 keeps the diaphragm alive"
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/vxP3l8W.png =250x)

## Helpful figure
![](https://i.imgur.com/UYqSjXt.png =450x)

## Clinical considerations
### Shoulder tip pain: refer from diaphragm
![](https://i.imgur.com/EoW7zYY.png =450x)

### Hiatus hernia
- Main symptom, dyspepsia
- Note: stratified squamous epithelium of esophagus can be exposed to acid produced by stomach’s columnar epithelium of stomach
- Left untreated, this will lead to gradual dysplasia and metaplasia of esophageal epithelium and esophageal cancer
- Treatment, conservative, pharmacological or surgical
- Fundoplication...
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/bFgydvh.png =250x)

### Hernia of Bochdalek
- Failure of left pleuroperitoneal membrane to close in-utero

- Action: elevate ribs, increasing intrathoracic volume during forced inspiration
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ddyKU4q.png =250x)
> Remember: pockets (put fingers in pockets, direction they're pointing is direction fibers of external inner costal muscles run for inspiration) 

### Internal intercostal 
- Span from sternum between costal cartilages of true ribs and from outer costal cartilages of false ribs
- Attachments: costal groove of rib to superior border of rib immediately below
- Do not enclose thorax posteriorly
- Terminate as posterior intercostal membranes
- Innervated by intercostal nerves
- Actions: 
    - Interosseous part depress ribs, decreasing intrathoracic volume during forced expiration
    - Interchondral part elevates ribs, increasing intrathoracic volume during forced inspiration
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/f1tXyXu.png =250x)
> Remember: tits (put hands on chest, direction they're pointing is direction fibers of innermost intercostal muscles run)

### Innermost intercostal group
- 3 muscles in this group
    1. Transversus Thoracis (anteriorly)
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/CQQRWbL.png =150x)
    2. Innermost intercostal muscles (laterally)
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/i2WS8fB.png =150x)
    3. Subcostalis (posteriorly)
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/iXun1h8.png =150x)

#### Transversus thoracis
- Lies between thoracic wall and parietal pleura
- Attachments: posterior surface of inferior sternum to internal surface of costal cartilages 2-6
- Action: very little action; weakly depresses ribs, reducing intrathoracic volume during forced expiration
- Innervated by intercostal nerves T2-T6 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/3W1CQSn.png =225x)

#### Innermost intercostals
- Lateral thoracic wall, deep to internal intercostals

- Fibers run in same direction as internal intercostals
    - Continuous with transversus thoracis anteriorly and subcostalis posteriorly
- Innervated by intercostal nerves
- Actions: 
    - Interosseous part depress ribs, decreasing intrathoracic volume during forced expiration
    - Interchondral part elevates the ribs, increasing intrathoracic volume during forced inspiration
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/SGVFSL8.png =225x)

#### Subcostalis
- Located inferior portion of thoracic wall
- Consists of thin slips of muscle, coursing from internal surface of rib angles in paravertebral gutter to 2nd or 3rd rib below
- Action: depresses ribs, decreasing intrathoracic volume during forced expiration
- Innervated by intercostal nerves
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/UTlvdJb.png =225x)

#### Extra muscle: levator costarum
- Origin: transverse processes of C7-T11

    - Innermost intercostal muscles
    - Transversus thoracis
    - Internal thoracic artery
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/zhDgRYA.png =350x)

## Neurovascular supply

- Collateral neurovascular bundles are given off at angle of the rib
    - Collaterals run above superior border of rib below
- Venous: posterior intercostal veins anastomose with anterior intercostal veins
- Arterial: posterior intercostal arteries anastomose with anterior intercostal arteries
- Nerves: intercostal nerves (see next slides)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ofUvlQd.png =350x)

### Intercostal nerves

- T12 spinal nerve anterior division is called subcostal nerve
- T3-T6 intercostal nerves are typical, rest are atypical
- Note: ganglia of sympathetic trunk resides in paravertebral gutter
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/GLHMAgp.png =225x)

### Typical spinal nerve (T3-T6)

### Atypical intercostal nerves
![](https://i.imgur.com/jTSnbYC.png =450x)

## Clinical considerations
### Triangle of safety
- Indicates an anatomical region where risk of inadvertently damaging important anatomical structures is minimised when introducing a chest tube or performing pleurocentesis
- Why is triangle relatively safe?
    - Too high to hit diaphragm, entering abdominal cavity (remember inverted J shape of diaphragm) and piercing abdominal viscera
    - Safest place to introduce needle or tube is directly above rib below because collateral neurovascular bundle is smaller than main neurovascular bundle in costal groove.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEc8fn6ownc
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/kVFOgCb.png =300x)

## Accessory muscles of respiration

    7. Serratus anterior
    8. Serratus posterior (superior and inferior)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/XSm0qRf.png =250x)

### Muscles of anterior chest wall
- When arms are fixed in certain positions, pectoralis major and minor can be recruited to assist with rib elevation and thus aid respiration
- With scapulae fixed, serratus anterior can assist with rib elevation during inspiration
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/LfYKhks.png =250x)

### Muscles of posterior chest wall

        - Action: elevates ribs during forced inspiration
        - Innervation: intercostal nerves
    - Inferior
        - Origin: T11-L3 spinous processes
        - Insertion: ribs 9-12
        - Action: depresses ribs during forced expiration

- Carina → main bronchi → lobar bronchi → segmental bronchi → subsegmental bronchi → terminal bronchiole → respiratory bronchiole → alveoli

#### Main bronchi
- Right main bronchus is wider, shorter and more vertical than left
    - Aspirated foreign bodies are therefore more likely to occupy right main bronchus than left
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/dxVxieL.png =225x)

#### Alveolus
- Site of gaseous exchange
- 90% lined by squamous type 1 pneumocytes (gas exchange)
- 10% lined by type 2 alveolar cells (surfactant production)
- Thin epithelial layer between alveolar epithelium and capillary endothelium (diffusion)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/VWg3Y6u.png =350x)

## Pleurae
### Pleural membranes
- Visceral and parietal pleurae
- Pleural space
    - 10-20ml pleural fluid
- Costophrenic angle
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/IJuRE1H.png =350x)
- Negative intrathoracic pressure keeps lungs and visceral pleura pressed against parietal pleural and endothoracic fascia
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Iu9v09F.png =350x)

### Clinical consideration
#### Pneumothorax
- Usually following injury to chest wall (e.g. stab)
- Loss of negative intrathoracic pressure, air rushes into  pleural space
- Ipsilateral lung collapses (atelectasis) as no negative pressure to keep it inflated
- Diagnosis is clinical, history + examination (percuss chest wall, hyper-resonant!)
- Note: lateral margin of collapsed right lung 
- Address cause (close wound) and insert chest tube and connect to drain to restore negative intrathoracic pressure over time (suction can be applied if needed)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/KUsw5En.png =200x)

#### Pleural effusion
- Abnormal collection of fluid in right pleural space
- Obliteration of right costophrenic angle
- Pleural effusion exhibits a meniscus
- Meniscus flat as patient was standing when x-ray was taken
- What would happen if patient lay down?
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/yLiCTKG.png =200x)

#### Pneumonectomy
- Complete whiteout of left hemithorax
- Collection of fluid in cavity of left lung
- Reduced breath sounds on auscultation, dull on percussion
- Removal of a lung lobe = lobectomy
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/tD6SHDX.png =200x)

## Bornchopulmonary segments
- Each lung is divided into bronchopulmonary segments (18 total)
- Right lung = 10, left lung = 8
- Each BP segment is a separate respiratory unit
- Each BP segment has its own segmental bronchus and artery
- Segments are drained by pulmonary veins that lie in septae between segment
    - Pulmonary veins drain their adjacent segments
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/F0NDYRC.png =300x) 

### Vascular supply of lungs and pleurae
- Lung is vascularised by 2 supplies: pulmonary and bronchial
- Bronchial:
    - Bronchial arteries:
        - 1 right: arises from aorta or a posterior intercostal artery (usually 3rd)
        - 2 left: arise from descending aorta
        - Supply carina to respiratory bronchioles where they anastomose
        - Perfuse visceral pleura
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/jlsYQ8f.png =250x)
    - Bronchial veins:
        - Superficial network: drains hilum and visceral pleura to azygos vein
        - Deep network: drain deep lung tissue to a pulmonary vein or directly to left atrium
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/7tHRgGI.png =250x)
- Pulmonary:
    - Pulmonary Arteries:
        - Left and right pulmonary arteries subdivide with bronchi eventually perfusing alveolar capillary beds with deoxygenated blood
        - Pulmonary arteries/arterioles do not supply bronchi
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/A6S2XcT.png =250x)
    - Pulmonary Veins:
        - Tributaries within intersegmental septae drain oxygenated blood from alveoli
        - These tributaries move towards hilum and continuously unite to form pulmonary venules/veins eventually forming 4 pulmonary veins that drain into left atrium (left and right, superior and inferior)
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/BIrrnEm.png =250x)

#### Respiratory bronchioles and alveoli
![](https://i.imgur.com/BTzGL96.png =350x)

### Innervation of lungs
- Lungs innervated by:
    - Sympathetic
        - Bronchodilation, vasoconstriction, inhibition of secretomotor
    - Parasympathetic
        - Bronchoconstriction, vasodilation, secretomotor
    - Visceral afferent fibers
        - Reflexive or nociceptive
- Pulmonary plexuses are located anterior and posterior to lung roots
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/i12XkMs.png =250x)
- Parietal pleura receives sensory innervation from intercostal nerves (T1-T11, costal and diaphragmatic pleura) and phrenic nerve (C3-5, mediastinal and central pleura)
- Visceral pleura is innervated by autonomic nerves via pulmonary plexus
    - Sensitive to stretch, questionable sensitivity to pain
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/YTOYdaX.png =250x)

### Lymphatic drainage of lung and pleurae
- Pulmonary lymphatic plexuses freely communicate with each other
- Subpleural lymphatic plexus
    - Bronchopulmonary (hilar) nodes
- Deep bronchopulmonary lymphatic plexus 
    - Intrinsic pulmonary nodes 
    - Bronchopulmonary (hilar) nodes
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZbifA8W.png =350x)

## Surface markings for lungs and pleurae

# Respiratory tract development
## Learning objectives
- Development of the larynx and trachea
- Development of the lung and pleurae
- Development of the diaphragm
- Clinical
    - Esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula
    - Polyhydraminos
    - Diaphragmatic herniation: morgagni and bochdalek
    - Pulmonary hypoplasia
    - Oligohydraminos

## Emergence of respiratory tree from foregut
### Formation of respiratory diverticulum
- Respiratory diverticulum is a ventral outpouching of foregut endoderm
- Endoderm forms epithelial lining of larynx, trachea, bronchial tree, alveoli
- Splanchnic mesoderm forms cartilage, muscle, connective tissue, pleura
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/wBYWN3q.png =200x)

### Separation of trachea and esophagus
- Respiratory diverticulum appears at week 4 with 2 lung buds
- Over 1-week, longitudinal tracheoesophageal ridges form, move closer together, and meet in midline forming tracheosophageal septum, separating primitive trachea and oesophagus
- Outgrowth of primitive trachea occurs as does septation between primitive trachea anteriorly and primitive oesophagus posteriorly
- Bronchial buds form during this process
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Iom7Mj8.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/Zf9d3ib.png =200x)

### Tracheoesophageal fistula
- Sometimes just called TEFs
- Caused by failure of tracheoesophageal septum to fully partition the primordial respiratory tract from primordial esophagus
- 1/3000 births
- ~84-90% occur in upper esophagus
    - Upper esophagus ends in blind pouch (atresia)
    - Lower esophagus forms a fistula with trachea
- Surgically managed with esophagoesophagostomy
- Note: some TEFs result in polyhydraminos
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/nH5YL7Z.png =350x)

### Polyhydraminos 
- Polyhydraminos = excess amniotic fluid
- Can occur due to tracheoesophageal fistula
- Mechanism:
    - Normal, water passes from mother to fetus through placenta/umbilical cord
    - Amniotic fluid expelled from fetal lungs and urinary system into amniotic sac
    - Amniotic fluid resorbed from amniotic sac by fetal
    - Swallowed amniotic fluid is absorbed by fetal digestive tract and can pass back to mother via umbilical cord/placenta, prevents excess buildup
    - In some TEFs, amniotic fluid swalled by fetus cannot pas to stomach and intestine for absorption
    - Without a resorption pathway, excess amniotic fluid accumulates
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/jN3xXTZ.png =250x)

## Development of laryngeal structures
### Pharyngeal arches
- Form from 4th week, travel ventrally and medially to meet its counterpart in midline
- Form rise to head and neck structures
- Each pharyngeal arch consists of a core of mesenchyme, inner lining of endoderm and outer lining of ectoderm
- Each arch has its own nerve supply, wherever musculature of a nerve migrates to during development, it carries its nerve supply with it
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/pxyb3J2.png =350x)

### Development of larynx and laryngeal orifice 
- Laryngeal orifice changes shape as laryngeal cartilages form (week 6-12) from 4th-6th pharyngeal arch mesenchyme
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/BacWmhm.png =450x)
- Note: rapid proliferation of laryngeal epithelium (weeks 7-10) causes temporary occlusion of larynx
- Patency of larynx is then restored by vacuolization/recanalization usually complete by week 10
- Failure of this process can leave a residual Laryngeal Web
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/AVir37T.png =250x)
#### Vacuolization/recanalization
- Vacuolization and recanalization produces a pair of lateral recesses, laryngeal ventricles
- Ventricles are bound by folds of tissue that differentiate into:
    - Vocal folds (true vocal folds) 
    - Vestibular folds (false vocal folds)
- Failure of vacuolisation/recanalization causes laryngeal web
- Figure: coronal section through larynx, looking from posterior to anterior
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/j9Gt9K0.png =250x)

#### Clinical consideration: laryngeal web
- 1/10000 births
- ~75% at glottic level
- Varying severity
- Presentation can be varied:
    - Respiratory distress
    - Stridor
    - Hoarse or weak voice
    - Frequent upper respiratory infections
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/khO0EwE.png =350x)

## Development of trachea
### Week 0-10
- As endodermal tube grows caudally, it differentiates and becomes respiratory epithelium
- Mesenchymal cells surround tube and ultimately form:
    - Cartilage
    - Connective tissue
    - Smooth muscle of its walls
- By week 8, mesenchymal rudiments of ~16-20 C-shaped cartilaginous rings are present.
- In following 2 weeks these rudiments form cartilages, beginning cranially and extending caudally
- At same time, connective tissue forms between cartilages and trachealis forms posteriorly
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/byhcVYm.png =250x)

### Week 12-20
- By week 12, mucosal glands arise in endoderm and develop in cranial to caudal direction
- By ~20th week, all major microscopic features of trachea are present
- Fetal trachea is comparatively short to the adult
    - Even in infant it is short (note epiglottis-soft palate overlap)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/dfM80MG.png =250x)

## Development of bronchi and lungs
### Bronchi, lungs and alveoli
- During its separation from foregut and esophagus, lung bud (endoderm) goes on to form bronchial buds and is surrounded by mesoderm
    - At beginning of 5th week, each bronchial bud enlarges to form left and right main bronchi
        - Right main bronchus then forms 3 lobar bronchi and left 2: reflecting lobes of right and left lungs respectively
    - Growth continues caudally and laterally in consuming space in pericardioperitoneal canals
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/bkLnvu3.png =450x)
- Pleuroperitoneal folds appear at beginning of week 5
    - These folds fuse anteriorly with septum transversum in week 7
        - This seperates thoracic and peritoneal cavities
    - As growth proceeds, endoderm continues to be surrounded by mesoderm
        - This mesoderm becomes pleura with visceral in direct contact with endoderm and parietal in contact with inner walls of primitive thoracic cavity
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/myHTqlz.png =250x)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/FyHQxst.png =250x)

### Pleurae
- Pleura form from mesoderm
- As bronchial tree grows and expands caudally and laterally from endoderm, it remains lined by mesoderm
- Mesoderm in direct contact with bronchial tree becomes visceral pleura
- Mesoderm in direct contact with body cavity becomes parietal pleura
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/lKVUEJD.png =350x)

### Lung development stages
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/KwKtCVf.png =450x)

### Clinical consideration: primary ciliary dyskinesia
- Mucous produced by respiratory mucosa is normally swept outwards by epithelial cilia
- Can be expelled via coughing etc. (removes pathogens)
- In PCD, abnormal structure/function of cilia undermines this process
    - Chronic nasal congestion
    - Recurring pneumonia
    - Chronic middle ear infections
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/CBRoXD1.png =250x)

## Development of diaphragm
- Pleuroperitoneal folds close pericardioperitoneal canals by growing anteriorly and medially
- Pleuroperitoneal folds fuse with septum transversarum and mesentery of esophagu
- Myoblasts from body wall also penetrate membranes forming  peripheral muscular part of diaphragm
- Initially, primitive diaphragm is at level of cervical somites and nerve components of 3rd – 5th  cervical spinal cord segments grow into septum
- Rapid growth of dorsal part of embryo (vertebral column) causes relative position of primitive diaphragm to migrate caudally
- During 4th week, septum transversarum lies opposite cervical but by 6th week it is at level of thoracic somites
- By 12th week, some dorsal bands of diaphragm originate at level of upper lumbar vertebrae (crura!)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/7gmaOXf.png =350x)

## Clinical considerations
### Congenital diaphragmatic hernia
- Caused by failure of formation of diaphragm
    - Most usually a failure of pleuroperitoneal fold to close pericardioperitoneal folds
- 1/2000 – 1/2500 live births
    - Male:female 2:1 , left:right 5:1
- Abdominal viscera migrate into thoracic cavity: pulmonary hypoplasia
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/qY4uj8p.png =250x)

### Pulmonary hypoplasia
- Pulmonary hypoplasia = small underdeveloped lungs
- Note migration of liver and small bowel (and likely spleen!) into thoracic left thoracic cavity
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/BUJD4ER.png =175x)

#### Another mechanism causing pulmonary hypoplasia
- Pulmonary hypoplasia can occur due to oligohydramnios
- (Note: oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios are opposites)
- Oligohydraminos = inadequate amniotic fluid
- Mechanism:
    - Kidney pathology
    - Less urine produced
    - Less amniotic fluid produced
    - Fetus squashed
    - Reduced intrathoracic cavity size
    - Smaller lungs
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/L3rX4I5.png =350x)

# Structural organisation of respiratory system
## Learning objectives
- Identify and describe the primary structures in the organisation of the respiratory system
- Identify the main histological aspects of each component of the conducting system and gas exchange region
- To relate structure to function of the conducting airways and gas exchange region

## Respiratory system structure and function
- Structure of respiratory system closely relates to its function
- Structure is arrangement of inter-related elements: e.g. building blocks such as tissue types:
    - Epithelium: number of cell layers, lines body surfaces
    - Connective tissue: collagen and elastin
    - Muscle: smooth muscle and skeletal muscle
    - Nervous: receive stimuli from internal and external environments, integrates signals
- Function is operation of each individual component as part of structure

### Respiratory system functions
- Airflow: movement of air in and out of site of gaseous exchange
- Gas exchange and transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide:
    - Provide oxygen: air → lungs → blood → tissues
    - Eliminate carbon dioxide: tissues → blood → lungs → air
- Conditions air: warm, filter and humidify air 
- Acid-base regulation: by controlling carbon dioxide, regulate blood pH
- Temperature regulation
- Metabolism: removal of noradrenaline, prostaglandins, 5-HT
- Hormonal activity: angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in lungs
- Immune protection: defend against microbes, toxic chemicals and foreign matter
- Maintain airway patency
- Production of sound/speech
- Olfactory sensation (sense of smell)

#### Respiratory system organisation
- Inspiration is movement of air from external environment into alveoli
- Expiration is movement of air from alveoli to external environment 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Gbxakrn.png =250x)

## Histology of respiratory tract
- Epithelium:
    - Respiratory System is covered by epithelium which varies down tract
    - Initially epithelial cells are pseudostratified columnar ciliated, then cuboidal then squamous
- Glands and goblet cells:
    - Upper respiratory tract has abundant glands, but they are absent from bronchioles onwards
    - Abundant goblet cells decrease in number until bronchioles
- Cartilage:
    - Cartilage is found throughout respiratory tract until small bronchi
    - In trachea cartilage is found in C-shaped rings; in bronchi as plates
- Smooth muscle:
    - Smooth muscle in trachea joins the C-shaped cartilage
    - Smooth muscle is found throughout bronchi and bronchioles which it surrounds completely
- Elastic tissue:
    - Elastic tissue is found in bronchi and bronchioles

### Histology of functional divisions
- Conducting Zone: (dead space region) 
    - Nasal cavity → terminal bronchioles
    - Get air in
    - Warm moisten air
    - Clean air
- Respiratory Zone: 
    - Respiratory bronchioles → alveoli
    - Gas exchange mechanism

### Upper respiratory tract
![](https://i.imgur.com/u7YjzfV.png =250x)

#### Nose and nasal cavity
- Air enters nasal cavity via nostrils (nares)
- Nose is subdivided into 2 nasal cavities (NC) separated by nasal septum (NS)
- Vestibule lined with hairs to trap large particles and mucus to trap debris in air
- Nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses (PS) are line by respiratory mucosa principally involved in filtering, humidifying and adjusting temperature of inspired air
- Turbinate bones (TB) project into nasal cavity and increase surface area which air flows over
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/u8wD8hS.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/1Dk273B.png =250x)

#### Nasal mucosa 
- Mucosa of nasal cavity is lined with pseudostratified ciliated columnar respiratory epithelium (RE)
- Contains mucin-secreting goblet cells
- Supported by lamina propria rich in blood vessels (V) and serous (S) and Mucous (M) glands, secretions of which trap small particles
- Mucous layer propelled to pharynx by cilia (muco-ciliary escalator) for digestion
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/g7UfgZg.png =250x)

#### Pharynx
- Passageway that connects nasal and oral cavity 
- Shared by digestive and respiratory systems
- Divided into 3 sections by location:
    - Nasopharynx: superior portion above soft palate 
    - Oropharynx: back of mouth cavity down to epiglottis
    - Hypopharynx: between hyoid bone and esophagus
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/n35q0jU.png =250x)
- Nasopharynx: respiratory epithelium and lamina propria contains seromucous glands 
- Lymphoid tissue (L) (Waldeyer ring of lymphoid tissue) adenoid
- Oropharynx non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/iLIUbI9.png =250x)

#### Larynx
- Larynx is continuous with trachea
- Superior end is attached to hyoid bone that lies below epiglottis
- Consists of 9 laryngeal cartilages (hyaline and elastic) connected by muscle and ligaments
- Maintains open passageway for air movement
- Prevents swallowed materials from entering trachea
- Sound production
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Kbaw6TL.png =250x)

### Lower respiratory tract

#### Airway branching
![](https://i.imgur.com/9wfzBX0.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/w7WuXht.png =350x)

#### Trachea
- Extends from larynx to midline of thorax where it divides into right and left main bronchi (~10cm long)
- Function: warm, clean and conduct air
- Distinct layers:
    - Mucosa (M)
        - Respiratory epithelium
            - Pseudostratified ciliated tall columnar cells
            - Goblet cells
            - Serous Cells 
            - Basal cells (lie close to basement membrane)
            - Brush Cells
        - Basement membrane
        - Lamina Propria
            - Highly vascular connective tissue and elastic fibres
    - Submucosa (SM)
        - Mixed seromucous glands
    - C-shaped hyaline cartilage rings (C )
        - ~16-20 pieces to provide flexible support to airway
        - Bands of smooth muscle (trachealis muscle) join free ends of posterior rings (T)
        - Contraction reduces diameter e.g. during coughing
    - Adventitia: connective tissue which tracheal adjacent structures
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/MMX2h6P.png =250x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/wMocOHY.png =350x)

#### Primary bronchus
- Right primary bronchus is shorter, wider and more vertical
- Basic structure is similar to trachea however:
    - Respiratory epithelium is less tall with fewer goblet cells (GC)
    - Lamina propria (LP) has more elastin fibres (El) and is separated from submucosa (SM) with smooth muscle (M) which becomes more prominent in distal bronchi
    - Submucosa has less seromucinous glands
    - Cartliage is in flattened interconnected plates rather than distinct rings
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/265FTtg.png =350x)

#### Bronchioles
- Airway <1mm diameter
- No cartilage or submucosal glands
- Ciliated columnar epithelium 
- Few goblet cells
- Bronchioles have a smooth muscle coats surrounded by fibroelastic connective tissue
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/0nsoT5D.png =250x)
- In larger bronchioles epithelium is simple columnar ciliated, with occasional goblet cells 
- In smaller bronchioles epithelium change to simple cuboidal, with no goblet cells 
- In terminal and respiratory bronchioles goblet cells are replaced with Club cells (formerly known as Clara cells)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Av6VLp2.png =350x)

##### Bronchioles: major points to remember
- Diameter 1 mm or less
    - Major characteristics
        - Bronchioles lack cartilage
        - Smooth muscle layer is relatively thicker (relative to lumen size).
        - Non-ciliated Clara cells are present in epithelium
        - Epithelium is simple columnar to simple cuboidal with fewer cilia
        - No glands in submucosa

### Gas exchange region: respiratory zone
- Region of gas exchange in lung (between air and blood;)
    - Respiratory bronchioles
    - Alveolar ducts
    - Alveolar sacs
    - Alveoli
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/DaeZ5FG.png =250x)
- Respiratory bronchioles:
    - Single alveoli in walls
    - Devoid of goblet cells
    - Ciliated cuboidal epithelium cells
    - Non-ciliated Club (Clara cells) cells: 
        - Produce a component of surfactant
        - Act as stem cells (able to divide)
        - Contain enzyme systems to detoxify
- Respiratory bronchioles divide into several alveolar ducts (AD) which have numbers of alveoli
- They appear as small aggregations of smooth muscle cells, collagen and elastic fibres
- Alveolar ducts end in an alveolar sac (AS) which in turns opens to several alveoli
- Each alveolus consists of a pocket open at one side
- Lined by flattened epithelial cells pneumocytes

#### Alveoli
- ~300 million air sacs
- Surface area (60-80m^2^)
- Each alveolus is 1 cell thick (250μm diameter)
- Surrounded by capillaries
- Alveolar pores (of Kohn)
    - Allow some movement of air between adjacent alveoli 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/SdpBXzY.png =350x)
- Alveolar wall consists of
    - Surface epithelium
    - Supporting tissue
    - Blood vessels
- Large squamous Type I pneumocytes (alveolar lining cells) P1
    - Large flattened cells 
    - 95% surface area of alveoli
    - Facilitate gas exchange
    - Maintain ion/fluid balance within alveoli
    - Communicate with type II cells
- Type II pneumocytes P2
    - Produce and secrete pulmonary surfactant (decreased surface tension prevents alveoli collapse)
    - ~3-5% of alveolar surface area
    - Expression of immunomodulatory proteins
    - Transepithelial movement of water 
    - Regeneration of alveolar epithelium after injury
- Capillaries (C ) with red blood cells (RBC)

### Pleura
- Formed of 2 layers
    - Parietal pleura forms internal lining of chest cavity
    - Visceral pleura: externally coats lungs
- Normally in contact but contain a small amount of serous fluid to lubricate movement during breathing
