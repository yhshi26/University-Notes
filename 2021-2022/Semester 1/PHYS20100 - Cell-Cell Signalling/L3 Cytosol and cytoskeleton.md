### **Cytosol:** 

- gelatinous semi-transparent fluid, approx. 50% of cell volume
- contains water, salts and organic molecules
- cytoplasmic organelles (ER, mitochondria etc.) suspended in the cytosol
- other cytosolic components
    - ribosomes, polyribosomes
    - enzymes
    - inclusions (glycogen, lipid, pigment)
    - components of signaling pathways
        - kinases
        - phosphatases
        - transcription factors

### **Cytoskeleton:**

Function:

- support
- motility
- organelle positioning
- railway track
- signalling

Structure:

- microtubules

Rail network, motor cargo: microfilaments

Motility, contraction: intermediate filaments

Structure, shape, cell-cell junctions

### **Filaments:**

1. #### **Microfilaments (Actin):** composed of monomers of the protein **G-actin (globular actin)**
    
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/47kj4ZX.png =200x)
    
    - **G-actin** assembles into a polymer of 2 twisting chains called **F-actin (filamentous actin)**
    - Make up a major portion of the cytoskeleton in all cells. They have important functions in determining cell shape, the ability of cells to move by amoeboid-like movements, cell division, and muscle cell contraction.
    - Function: cell shape and support, motility, important for cytokinesis, division of the cytoplasm to form 2 daughter cells, cytoplasmic streaming, the movement of cytoplasm within a cell, forming protuberances, microvilli support, muscle contraction (with myosin)
2. #### **Intermediate filaments (several proteins):** composed of twisted strands of several different proteins, including **keratin, desmin, and lamin**
    - Contribute to cell shape and help anchor nucleus. Provide considerable strength to cells and consequently are most extensively developed in the regions of cells subject to mechanical stress (for example, in association with desmosomes).
3. #### **Microtubules (tubulin):** hollow tubes about 25 nm in diameter, whose subunits are composed of the protein **tubulin**

    - The most rigid of the cytoskeletal filaments. Are present in the long processes of neurons, where they provide the framework that maintains the processesâ€™ cylindrical shape. Radiate from a region of the cell known as the centrosome, which surrounds two small, cylindrical bodies called centrioles, composed of 9 sets of fused microtubules.
        
        **The centrosome:** a cloud of amorphous material that regulates the formation and elongation of microtubules
        
        - during cell division, the centrosome generates the microtubular spindle fibers used in chromosome separation
        - microtubules and actin filaments have also been implicated in the movements of organelles within the cytoplasm
        - these fibrous elements form tracks, and organelles are propelled along these tracks by contractile proteins attached to the surface of the organelles

#### **Cilia:** hair-like projections on the surfaces of most cells 

- have a central core of microtubules organized in a pattern similar to that found in the centrioles
- these microtubules, in combination with a contractile protein, produce movements of the cilia
- in hollow organs lined with ciliated epithelium, the movements of the cilia help propel the contents of the organ along the surface of the epithelium
    - an example of this is the cilia-mediated movement of mucus against gravity up the trachea, which helps remove inhaled particles that could damage the lungs

### **Movement within cell:**

#### **Attachment proteins:**

- dynein and kinesin: motor proteins
- move along the growing ends of the microtubule (towards and away from the cell center respectively)
- can attach to the membranes of organelles thus providing a means for movement of organelles within a cell (railway track)

### **Intermediate filaments:**

- diverse proteins (approx. 70 family members)
- 8-12 nm diameter
- great tensile strength
    
    #### **Intermediate filaments are like ropes comprised of long twisted strands of protein:**

    Tetramers are nonpolar due to N and C terminal alignment both ways 
    
    - meshwork organization
    - mechanical strength and resistance to shear stress
    - high metazoans
    - not found in all cells
        - most do
        - mainly found in animal cells, not plant cells
    - toughest and most durable of the cytoskeleton filaments
    
    #### **Intermediate filaments strengthen animal cells by keeping them together:**

    #### **Humans have >50 types of intermediate filaments:**

    #### **Genetic diseases:**
    
    Epidermolysis bullosa simplex:
    
    - mutations in gene encoding for cytokeratins 5 and 15
    - results in lack of cohesion between epithelial cells and underlying basement membrane causing blistering and fluid loss
