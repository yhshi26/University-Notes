## Immune response overview

### Functions of phagocyte in innate immune responses, hormonal regulation

### Basic signalling goals
- activate local vasculature
- attract inflammatory (phagocytic) cells
- activate infiltrating phagocytic cells

(know for exam: what is the signal, what type is it, what receptor is involved, what is activated)

### Inflammation
- inflammatory mediators act on local blood vessels and activate endothelium
    - dilation 
    - increased permeability
    - increased local blood volume
    - decreased flow rate
    - increased adhesiveness
    - pain

#### Soluble inflammatory mediators
- histamine: stored preformed in mast cells
- prostaglandins & leukotrienes
    - rapidly synthesised
    - products of phospholipid breakdown by phospholipase A2
    - prostacyclin
        - vasodilation
    - PGE2 important endothelial cell product
        - vasodilation
        - fever
    - LTB4
        - chemokine
    - cytokines
        - interleukins

### Chemotaxis
- the phenomenon by which cell movement is directed in response to an extracellular chemical gradient
- chemokines (kinos = movement) released by **pathogen or by cells** at site of infection/injury
- chemokines bind to extracellular matrix
- inflammatory cells can follow "chemokine trail" and move up concentration gradient
- ligation of chemokine receptors promotes actin polymerisation
    - motility dependent on cytoskeletal rearrangement

#### Example: recruiting a monocyte/macrophage
1. monocyte moving through blood in blood vessel
2. encounters activated endothelium
3. adheres, rolls, migrates through blood vessel wall
4. follows chemokine gradient, encounters PAMPS (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) and inflammatory mediators produced in tissue
    - 
5. arrives at site of infection where it clears pathogen

## PAMPS: produced only by microbes
- invariant between microorganisms of a given class
    - limited number of germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can detect any microbial infection
    - e.g. conserved lipid A reveals all gram-negative bacteria
- essential for microbial survival
    - escape mutants not generated

## PRRs (pattern recognition receptors) 
- endocytic
    - promote phagocytosis
- signalling
    - toll-like receptors (TLRs)
- secretion
    - lectins, etc.
    - complement receptor (opsonins)
    - c reactive protein

### TLRs (toll-like receptors)
- at least 12 TLRs
- dozens of ligands
    - mostly conserved PAMPs
- most/all TLR recognize several ligands
- some TLRs require accessory proteins
- thought to directly bind ligands therefore are PRRs

#### NF~K~B: master regulator of inflammatory gene expression

#### Cytokines
- cell-cell signalling proteins and peptides that are crucial in controlling the growth and activity of other immune system cells and blood cells
- can activate auto-, para- and endocrine responses
- small proteins (8-30kDa)
- slow to make but potent response
- **produced by the host**
- eg: large family of interleukins
    - IL-1 to IL-38
    - TNFa

#### Interleukin 1 beta
- autocrine
    - activated monocytes produce IL-1beta
    - promotes phagocytic capacity
- paracrine: released by mono/macs
    - activates endothelium
        - upregulates adhesion molecule expression
- endocrine
    - stimulates endothelial cells in hypothalamus and resets thermostat
        - endogenous pyrogen

##### Type 1 interleukin receptor
