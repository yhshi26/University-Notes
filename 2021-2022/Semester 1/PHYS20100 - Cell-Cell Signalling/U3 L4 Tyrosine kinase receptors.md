## Receptor functions of proteins
- ligands can be classified in 2 groups:
    - most chemical messengers are water-soluble and bind to receptors located at the plasma membrane
    - a smaller number of messengers, like steroids, are lipid-soluble and bind to an intracellular receptor

### Transmembrane proteins: LGIC and GPCR (respond to water-soluble ligands)

#### cGMP
- functions as both a receptor and as a guanylyl cylcase which catalyzes formation in the cytoplasm of a molecule known as cyclic GMP (cGMP)

## Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)

### Classes of RTKs
- **receptor tyrosine kinases:**
    - receptor has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity
        - insulin
        - epidermal growth factor (EGF)
        - platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
        - colony-stimulating factor (CSF)
        - fibroblast grwoth factor (FGF)
        - vascular endothelilal grwoth factor (VEGF)
- **receptor-associated tyrosine kinase:**
    - membrane bound receptor activates an intracellular tyrosine kinase such as janu kinase (JAK)
        - prolactin
        - growth hormone
        - erythryopoietin
        - many of the itnerleukins and itnerferons (cytokines)

## Receptor tyrosine kinases
### Diagram: structure of RTKs
- EGF binding
    - see TKR monomer (a))
- oligodimerisation
    - RTKs always work in pairs (dimers) (b))
- auto-phosphorylation

### Diagram: steps in activation of RTKs
- EGF binding
- oligodimerisation
- auto-phosphorylation
- binding of adaptor proteins
- deactivation:
    - dephosphorylation 
    - internalization
![](https://i.imgur.com/Kj2nWEg.png =450x)
- RTKs are membrane receptors (single transmembrane segment)
- RTKs are dimeric
- many different bidning proteins can be associated (polymorphic parallel signals)
- switched off by tyrosine phosphatases or degradation

### Cellular functions of RTKs
- growth
- proliferation
- movement
- survival
- differentiation
- notes:
    - responses usually slow (hours)
    - mutations associated with cancer
    - emphasise tyrosine (vs. serine) kinases

### Effector functions of RTKs
#### 1: Ras proteins
- receptor activation
- adaptor (docking protein) recognise TYR-P 
- activation of GEFs
- Ras Exchange GDP/GTP
- Ras binds to effectors
![](https://i.imgur.com/rO4AEed.png =450x)
- **distinct from large heterotrimeric g proteins**

##### Downstream signalling cascade, MAPK (Ser/Thr kinases), RAS canonical effector pathway
![](https://i.imgur.com/hMy4kko.png =450x)
- **cell growth, differentiation, survival**

#### 2: PI~3~ kinase

##### Cell surface receptors ligands: dimers, monomers

## Receptor-associated tyrosine kinases
- receptor itself does not have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity
- relies on recruiting a separate tyrosine kinase enzyme
    - eg. janus kinase (1-3), Tyk-2
- ligand induces receptor dimerisation which in turn activates associated kinase
- kinase cascade results in regulation of gene expression

### Jak-STAT pathway
- ligand binds
- dimerisation
- cross-activation of receptor bound JAKs
- JAKs phosphorylate TYR in receptor intracellular domain
- tyr-P are docking sites for STATS (transcription factors regulators)
- STATs regulate transcription (long process)

- example: prolactin activating JAK-STAT pathway for milk production

## Clinical relevance of RTKs
- diabetes: insulin - metabolism
- cancer: VEGF - tumor growth
- cancer: herceptin (trastuzumab)
- anemia: EPO

### RTK mutations common in cancers
- target therapy for several cancers such as:
    - lung cancer
    - colorectal cancer
- example of personalised/precision medicine
    - prevent dimerisation to stop proliferation of cells

### Mutant Ras

- 90% pancreatic cancer, 50% colon cancer caused by Ras gene mutations
- mutations of many of these genes are associated not only with cancer but RASopathies
    - RASopathies: developmental syndromes caused by germline mutations in genes that alter the Ras subfamily and mitogen-activated protein kinases including:
