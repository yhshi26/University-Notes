### Receptors in biology, medicine, and therapeutics
- we are focussing on protein receptors activated by chemical signals
    - receptor: a molecule inside or on the surface of a cell that binds to a specific substance and causes a specific effect in the cell

### Ligand-gated ion channels
> learning objectives: describe basic structure and functions of ligand-gated ion channels, understand how LGICs regulate membrane potential, be familiar with examples of how LGICs are clinically important (examples of relevant diseases, good pharmacological targets)

#### Types of ion channels classified by mode of activation

### What are LGICs (ligand-gated ion channels)?
- membrane-spanning, pore-forming proteins that open or close in response to an endogenous chemical messenger (ligand)
- distinct from voltage-gated ion channels (which are dependent on membrane potential-control loop)

#### Figure: LGIC 
- signal is a first messenger that activates change in membrane polarisation

#### Structure: LGIC (Ach receptor)
- composed of 5 transmembrane protein subunits
- each unit 4 transmembrane alpha helices (hydrophobic) forming a hydrophilic pore
- when Ach binds, conformational change results in channel opening
- negatively charged side chains ensure charge selectivity for positive ions (Na^+^ and K^+^)

#### Key features: LGICs
- can allow passage of ions in or out of cell (driven by **electrochemical gradient**)
- exhibit charge and size selectivity making them selecrtive for one or two specific ions of similar size and charge
- direct link between ligand binding and channel opening (**no second messenger**) - allows rapid response
- transition between closed and open in response to ligand (altered open probability)
- in the context of neurons, can be excitatory (Ach, glutamate) or inhibitory (GABA or glycine) with respect to initiating an action potential

#### Measuring LGICs
- patch clamp (Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann' 1991 Nobel Prize Medicine)

#### Examples of LGIC ligands
- very common in nervous system, muscle, and other tissues where we need fast response
- can be activated by other channels or receptors

|          | Ligand | Signal |
| -------- | ------ | ------ |
| extracellular ligand | GABA | Cl^-^ | 
| | glycine | Cl^-^ | 
| | acetylcholine | **Na^+^**, K^+^, Ca^2+^ | 
| | ATP | Ca^2+^, Na^+^, K^+^ | 
| | 5HT (serotonin) | Na^+^, K^+^ | 
| intracellular ligand | cAMP | Na^+^, K^+^ | 
| | cGMP | Na^+^, K^+^ | 
| | InsP3 | Ca^2+^ | 
| | Ca^2+^ | Ca^2+^ | 
| | ATP | K^+^ | 

#### Examples of neurotransmitter receptors
| Functional type | Ligand | Signal |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ |
| excitatory receptors | acetylcholine (nicotinic receptor) |  Na^+^/K^+^ | 
| | glutamate (NMDA class receptors) | Na^+^/K^+^ and Ca^2+^ | 
| | glutamate (non-NMDA class receptors) | Na^+^/K^+^ | 
| | serotonin (5HT~3~ class receptors) | Na^+^/K^+^ | 
| inhibitory receptors | y-aminobutyric acid, GABA (A-class receptors) | Cl^-^ | 
| | glycine | Cl^-^ | 

#### Functions of LGICS
- maintain intracelluar ionic homeostasis (osmolarity, acid base balance, etc.)
- play a key role in neurotransmission (e.g. Ach receptor at the neuromuscular junction)
- regulation of contractility in cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems
- regulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells

## Ion channelopathies
- acquired channelopathy
    - myasthenia gravis (autoimmune)
- genetic
    - more than 40 disorders related to ion channel mutations
        - e.g. cystic fibrosis, epilepsy, etc.

### LGIC as pharmacologic targets
- insomnia, **anxiety, depression** and schizophrenia
- example 1: barbituates and tranquilizers such as valium tamezepan bind GABA-gated CL^-^ channels makes channels easier to open (more sensitive to GABAs inhibitory action)
- example 2: tubucurarine (skeletal muscle relaxant) antagonises the Ach receptor leading to decreases excitatory signaling

## Summary: ligand-gated ion channels 
- open/close in response to ligand
- directly modulate membrane potential
    - inhibitory (induces or maintains hyperpolarisation)
    - excitatory (induces depolarisation)
- ligand can be intracellular
    - IP3, K~ATP~
- ligand can be extracellular
    - nAChR, GABA
- important in disease
- important in therapeutic targets

### Pathways initiated by water-soluble messengers
- **critical points:**
    - there is a broad range of receptors:
        - ion channels
        - G-protein coupled receptors
        - receptors with intrinsic kinase activity
        - etc.
    - various receptors activate intracellular signaling cascades that affect cell function
    - these receptors can activate downstream mediators which affect DNA transcription, but also have other effects on the cell
    - this is a faster response compared to intracellular receptor action, but it is a less sustained response

### Receptors that are ligand-gated ion channels
- activation of the receptor by a first messenger (ligand) results in a conformational change of the receptor so it forms an open channel through the plasma membrane
- because the opening of ion channels has been compared to the opening of a gate in a fence, these types of channels are known as ligand-gated ion channels
- the opening of ligand-gated ion channels in response to binding of a first messenger results in an increase in the net diffusion across the plasma membrane of one or emore types of ions specific to that channel
- this often results in a change in the membrane potential of a cell
