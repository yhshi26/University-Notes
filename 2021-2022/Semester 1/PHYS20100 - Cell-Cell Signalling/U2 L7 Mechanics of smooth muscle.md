## Review: smooth muscle contraction
- more complex than skeletal muscle
    - multiple competing inputs

### Contractile signals in smooth muscle
- not normally direct voluntary control
- spontaneous electrical activity
    - peristalsis
- neurotransmitters released by autonomic neurons
    - sympathetic (fight/flight)
    - parasympathetic (rest/digest)
- hormonal secretions
- local factors e.g. changes in chemical composition of the fluid around the cell

### Signal types controlling calcium levels
- pacemakers
- voltage-gated channels (1)
- ligand-gated channels (2)
    - activated by neurotransmitter/hormone
- second messenger induced calcium release from SR (3)
    - IP~3~
    - Ca^2+^

### Activating signals in smooth muscle leads to either:
1. increased cytosolic calcium concentration
2. altered sensitivity to the available calcium

### Control of calcium in smooth muscle
- **ligand-gated** channels (receptor operated calcium channels e.g. sensitive to ATP, noradrenaline, acetylcholine)
    - activated by neurotransmitter/hormone
- **voltage gated** channels (L-type calcium channels, similar ot DHP)
    - activated by action potential
- **second messenger induced calcium release** from sarcoplasmic reticulum
    - activated by IP~3~ (IP~3~-gated channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum)
    - activated by calcium (calcium-induced-calcium release channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum)

#### Mechanisms of calcium release
- smooth muscles have areas similar to motor end plants called calveolus
    - the calveolus have areas of concentration of **ligand and hormone** receptors (**2 in diagram**)
- there are also **voltage-gated calcium channels** (L-type channel, similar to DHP in the T-tubule of skeletal muscle, **1 in diagram**)
    - these can open due to change in voltage and allow influx of calcium
- smooth muscle: release of calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum
    - calcium-induced-calcium release channels (CICR)
        - opened by increased calcium in cytosol
    - IP~3~-gated calcium channel
        - opened by binding of IP~3~

## New content
### Questions: 
- what happens when intracellular calcium concentration is released? 
- how does the cross-bridge cycle begin in smooth muscle?

### Cross-bridge cycling: smooth vs skeletal
- calcium driven changes in the thick filaments turn on cross-bridge activity in smooth muscle
    - in skeletal muscle, change occurs in thin filaments
- smooth muscle myosin is a different gene to skeletal muscle
    - canot interact with actin on the thin filament unless it's phosphorylated
- smooth muscle thin filament doesn't have troponin but skeletal does

#### Smooth muscle cell: filaments
- thin filaments
    - actin rich
    - attached to dense bodies
- thick filaments
    - myosin rich
    - reside between two dense bodies
    - appear to overlap a portion of thin filament similar ot striated muscle
    - two-headed (bipolar nature) means actin in thin filament is pulled towards the centre of the thick filament

#### Smooth muscle: cross-bridge cycle 
- interaction of filaments during smooth muscle cross-bridge cycle
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/Di2NgAd.png =250x)
- steps in smooth muscle cross-bridge cycle
    - at rest
        - myosin bound to ADP and phosphate (P~i~)
    - in presence of high calcium
        - calcium-calmodulin (Ca-CM) binds to myosin-light-chain kinase (MLCK)
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/z9X50pI.png =150x)
        - MLCK uses ATP to phosphorylate myosin on thick filament
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/53HJd16.png =150x)
        - phosphorylated myosin can now bidn to actin on the thin filament
        - a power stroke similar to skeletal muscle occurs in which the binding of myosin to actin causes a flex in the cross-bridge
        - this displaces ADP and phosphate leaving a binding site for ATP available
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/y09TpB6.png =150x)
        - binding of ATP reduces affinity of myosin for actin which allows them to separate
        - myosing ATPase hydrolyses ATP; energy from bound ATP is used to reset the myosin head ready for another cycle
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/GTn6A67.png =150x)
    - as long as myosin is phosphorylated, the cross-bridge cycle can continue

### Relaxation
#### Steps/phases in relaxation
1. reduction in calcium concentration in the cytosol
2. dephosphorylation of myosin

#### Reduction in calcium concentration in the cytosol
1. calcium normalization
    - at end of an excitation signalling event: calcium concentration in the cytosol is reduced by calcium ATPase, a sodium calcium exchanger and the SERCA that pumps calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum
    - reduction in calcium deactivates myosin-light chain kinase (MLCK)
3. store refill
    - mechanism 1 may result in variable amounts of calcium remaining in the sarcoplasmic reticulum; refill of the sarcoplasmic reticulum occurs in areas where the plasma membrane of the smooth muscle cell (sarcolemma) is in contact with the sarcoplasmic reticulum
5. store refill
    - stim1, a protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, senses calcium depletion changing its conformation, which signals to a protein in the SOC; the SOC opens and allows calcium to flow into the cytosol so it can replenish the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores

- diagram: SOC = store-operated calcium channel, SERCA = sarcoplasmic-reticulum-calcium ATPase

#### Dephosphorylation of myosin
1. free Ca^2+& in cytosol decreases when Ca^2+^ is pumped out of the cell or back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum
2. Ca^2+^ unbinds from calmodulin (CaM)
3. myosin phosphatase removes phosphate from myosin, which decreases myosin ATPase activity
4. less myosin ATPase results in decreases muscle tension

##### Latchbridge formation
- if myosin is dephosphorylated when still attached to actin it locked in place (latches)
- occurs when calcium minimally over-elevated

#### Phosphorylation vs dephosphorylation of myosin
- as long as cytoplasmic calcium is elevated, MLCK keeps phosphorylating myosin
- myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) dephosphorylates myosin **(dephosphorylation in black arrow)**
- at high levels of calcium MLCK ratio reater than MP
- if myosin is dephosphorylated when attached to actin, it forms the latch
    - this slows the cross-bridge cycle as myosin needs to be rephosphorylated

## Fine-tuning of smooth muscle contraction (altering sensitivity of the system to calcium mediated contraction)
- balance between the activity of myosin light chain kinase and myosin phosphotase fine tunes contraction in smooth muscle

### Altering sensitivity to calcium mediated conctraction: RhoA pathway
- RhoA is activated indirectly following receptor binding e.g. norepinephrine, angiotensin II
- ROCK is a serine-threonine protein kinase regulated bby RhoA, a G protein
- one of its targets in MYPT1 which **inhibits MLCP** promotes contraction
- agonists that activate phospholipase C to promote contraction via IP~3~ simultaneously activate PKC
- PKC can phosphorylate many proteins that regulate contraction ,including CPI-17 (PKC-potentiated inhibitor protein of 17kDa)
- CPI-17 binds to the PP1c MLCP catalytic domain and inhibits **MLCP** to promote contraction

#### NO activates MLCP to cause vasodilation (relaxation of vascular smooth muscle)
- in vascular smooth muscle, **nitric oxide (NO)** activates a soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC), which stimulates the activity of a PKG isoform common to smooth muscle (PKG1a)
- PKG1a binds to a carboxyterminal leucine zipper domain on MYPT1
- activating MYPT1 promotes MLCP activity and causes smooth muscle relaxation

- diagram: MLCK = myosin light-chain kinase (myosin phosphatase), MLCP = myosin light-chain kinase phosphatase, MYPT1 = MLCP myosin-binding subunit, NO = nitric oxide, PKC = protein kinase C, PKG-1a = protein kinase G1a, PP1c = MLCP protein phosphatase subunit, ROCK = Rho-kinase

#### How noradrenalin causes contraction (alpha1 adrenoreceptor)
1. IP~3~ mediated calcium release
2. inactivation of MLCP by the Rho pathway

## Summary
- multiple signals increase intracellular calcium
- calcium-calmodulin is critical for contraction (not troponin)
- myosin phosphorylation is essential for the cross-bridge cycling
- reduction in calcium and myosin dephosphorylation are essential for relaxation
