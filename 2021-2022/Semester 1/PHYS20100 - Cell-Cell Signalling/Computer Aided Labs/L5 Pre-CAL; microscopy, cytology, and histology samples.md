> Computer-aided-learning (CAL) classes are designed to apply a computer program based approach to discuss the material covered in lectures. There is and additional aim that is to work on acquisition of transferable skills that you can use in the future. These classes will take place in person in computer labs with the guidance of tutors.
> 
> In the first CAL you have to go through the images and identify the structure asked in questions. In some CALs we will use a tool called PathXL for which you need a login.

## CAL 1 objectives
1. navigate through an electron micrograph
2. understand the appearance (structure) of an animal cell
3. locate and identify a number of subcellular organelles
4. relate cell structure to cell function

## How to study an electron micrograph
1. note the scale bar to keep a sense of proportion
2. the size of the nucleus is a useful reference with respect to other organelles
3. identify the plasma membrane, it defines the limits of the cell
4. mitochondria are often easy to identify
5. the number of organelles can often tell you the function of the cell and the identity of the tissue
