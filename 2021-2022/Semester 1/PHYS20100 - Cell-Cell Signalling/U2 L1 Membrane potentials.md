## **Excitable cells:**

- able to generate, transmit, and respond to electrical signals (action potential)

### **Excitable tissues:**

- regions of the body that contribute to the transmission of electrical signals

    Nerve and muscle tissues respectively
    
    1. sensory receptors
    2. neuron cell bodies
    3. axons 
    4. muscles
    
## **Nervous system:**

- central nervous system (CNS)
    - brain
    - spinal cord
- peripheral nervous system (PNS)
    - nerves connecting CNS to muscles, glands, etc.
    
    **Cells types:**
    
    - neurons
        - the functional unit of the nervous system
        - generate electrical signals
        - release neurotransmitters (chemical signals)
    - glia
        - cells that support neuron function

### **Neurons:**

#### **Subtypes:**

- efferent neuron
    - away from CNS
- afferent neuron
    - towards CNS
- interneuron
    - connection between neurons in the CNS

#### **Neuron connections:**

#### **Sensory receptors:**

- information about the body's temperature, pressure, light, sound waves is used by the sensory receptors in the body to send signals to the CNS
    - sensory receptors: specialized ending of afferent neurons, generate signal (receptor potential) that can activate the neuron and thus signal to CNS

#### **Signal transduction in neurons:**

1. **dendrites** receive information
2. **cell body** integrates signal
3. **axon** conducts signal (action potential)
4. **axon terminal** transmits signal (neurotransmitter release)
    
    can synapse with another nerve or a muscle

### **Muscle:**

All muscle cells have the ability to contract

- electrical signal received and converted into mechanical function

#### 3 types of muscle:

1. smooth muscle
    
    e.g. peristaltic movement of gut
    
2. cardiac muscle
3. skeletal muscle
    - attached to bones via tendons
    - conscious and reflex activation
    

## **Electrical charge in the cell: basic principles:**

Intracellular fluid (ICF): high concentrations of potassium (K+) ions 

Extracellular fluid (ECF): high concentrations of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions

Distribution of these charged ions leads to electrical phenomena at the cell's plasma membrane

### **Ion movement across a cell membrane:**

### **Potential difference:**

- separated electrical charges of opposite signs have the potential to do work if they come together: electrical potential/potential difference
- magnitude of potential difference depends on:
    - the difference in amount of charge
- measured in volts

### **Current:**

- the movement of electrical charge
- the electrical potential between charged makes them flow, producing current
- magnitude of current depends on:
    - potential difference between charges
    - nature of the material through which it is moving

### **Ohm's law:**

- resistance is the hindrance to movement of charge
    - high resistance = low current
- the effect of voltage (V) and resistance (R) on current (I) is expressed in Ohm's law: I = V/R
- examples:
    - insulators: high resistance, reduce current flow (e.g. cell membrane)
    - conductors: low resistance, rapid current flow (e.g. intracellular and extracellular fluid)

## Definitions
- membrane potential: voltage difference between the **inside and outside** of the cell
- resting membrane potential: the steady potential of an **unstimulated** cell
- equilibrium potential: **voltage difference** across a membrane that produces flux of an ion that is **equal but opposite** to the flux due to the **concentration gradient** of the same ion
    - **equilibrium potential for an ion calculated using nernest equation**
        - there is **no net movement** of ions when the ions are in electrochemical equilibrium across the membrane
        - **different for every ion;** depends on concentration gradients between the intracellular fluid (ICF) and extracellular fluid (ECF)
        - nernst equation: gives the equilibrium potential = electrical potential necessary to **balance** a given ionic concentration gradient across a membrane so the net flux of the ion is zero

## **Resting membrane potential (RMP):**

- all cells under resting conditions have an electrical potential difference across their plasma membranes
    - inside the cell is negatively charged in comparison to the outside of the cell
        - due to small excess of neg ions inside cell and small excess pos ions outside cell
        - the neg and pos ions are electrically attracted to each other, and create a thin shell of charge difference (potential) by membrane
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/sAachhC.png =200x)
    - this potential is RMP, the measure of the potential difference when comparing inside to outside (the voltage reference point)
    - all cells have a RMP

### How cells develop RMP
> movement of ions: Na+ and K+

**Factors determining RMP:**
1. differences in **ion concentrations** inside and outside the cell: **Na+ and K+** are most important
2. differences in **membrane permeability** to different ions
3. presence of **ion pumps** in the plasma membrane 
    e.g. sodium/potassium ATPase (Na+/K+ -ATPase)

#### 1. ion concentrations
![](https://i.imgur.com/yJCAMce.png =350x)

#### 2. ion permeability
- multiple types of ion channels present in most membranes
- need to consider the permeabilities and concentration gradients for all ions
- greater membrane permeability for 1 type of ion = greater contribution said ion makes to RMP

#### 3. ion pumps
**Sodium/potassium pump (Na+/K+ - ATPase):**
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/9Qjn8Iq.png =150x)
    - pump sets up concentration gradients for Na+ and K+
    - pump has small electrogenic effect - more pos ion pumped out than in
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/X0m4NFJ.png =150x)
    - more k+ going out due to leak channels
    - more pos ions out = ICF becomes more neg = neg membrane potential
- steady state: RMP
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/d8LG4ud.png =150x)
    - Na+: high electrochemical gradient, low permeability (leak)
    - K+: low electrochemical gradient, high permeability (leak)

### Calculating RMP
- **concentration gradient** of an ion = gives equilibrium potential
- **relative permeability** of all ions = determines how strongly each ion's equilibrium potential affects the RMP
- calculated using modified nernst equation

### RMP in neurons
- RMP closer to equilibrium potential for K+
- **equilibrium potential:** **voltage difference** across a membrane that produces flux of an ion that is **equal but opposite** to the flux due to the **concentration gradient** of the same ion
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/HgGPO6J.png =150x)

#### Role of chloride (Cl-) in RMP in neurons
- no pump movement of Cl-
    - i.e. no active movement against concentration gradient
- [Cl-] shifts until equilibrium potential for Cl- = RMP of cell
- Na and K determine the -70mV RMP
    - this causes Cl- to move out of cell away from neg charge in cell, leading to greater [Cl-] outside cell
    - this can be balanced out by diffusion of Cl- back in
    - Cl no direct role, bystander to the RMP set-up by Na and K
