> The following three examples relate to the significance of cellular membrane potentials in health and disease. Whilst you will not be examined on clinical situations in this module **these examples highlight the learning objectives of your lectures on membrane potentials, action  potentials,  and the neuromuscular  junction.** **Please read and think  about each example** before attending the tutorial. **Please be prepared to discuss the role of membrane potentials, etc, in each setting.** Please remember that the goal of the tutorial is for you to link lecture material with these examples and not go into detailed discussion on the clinical features of disease or current treatments. 
> 
> Within the tutorial session you will be assigned to one “breakout” group where you willdiscuss one of the questions below in-depth. Your group will be asked to present this discussion to the whole tutorial class after approximately 15-20 minutes of discussion. The assignment associated with this tutorial is outlined on the Tutorial 2 worksheet.

## Question 1: 
How does digoxin work to increase calcium levels and thus cardiac contractility? 
- Digoxin works as a Na^+^K^+^ -ATPase inhibitor. As  Na^+^K^+^ -ATPase functions to maintain osmotic equilibirum and membrane potential in cells, inhibiting its function results in intracellular Na^+^ buildup, triggering Ca^2+^ membrane channels to open. This increases Ca^2+^ influx into cardiac cells, resulting in cross-bridge formation between thick (myosin) and thin (actin) filaments which slide parallel to each other, triggering contraction.
### In your discussion consider:
- What is the physiological role of the Na+/K+ATPase?
    - The physiological role of Na^+^K^+^ -ATPase is regulating cell osmotic equilibrium and membrane potential. Na^+^K^+^ -ATPase facilitates movement of Na^+^ and K^+^ against their concentration gradients. This results in the cell having a higher extracellular concentration of Na^+^ and a higher intracellular concentration of K^+^. 
- Consider how cardiac myocytes might regulate their intracellular calcium levels.
    - Cardiac myocytes regulate intracellular Ca^2+^ levels through a continuous Ca^2+^ flux across the cell membrane. Sarcolemmal reticulum L-type Ca^2+^ channels regulate influx, while sarcolemmal reticulum Ca^2+^ ATP-ase channels regulate efflux of Ca^2+^. 
    - Intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cardiomyocytes is mainly regulated by sarcolemmal (SL) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) proteins, and the mitochondrion and nucleus are also considered to participate in this process to some extent (6, 17, 42). SL L-type Ca2+ channels are the major pathways of Ca2+ entry, whereas SL Ca2+ pump ATPase is involved in Ca2+ efflux from cardiomyocytes. 
### Information for Question #1:
#### Cardiac Glycosides 
The active compound in foxgloves is digoxin. Digoxin is one of a class of compounds called the cardiac glycosides.  Therapeuticuses of cardiac glycosides primarily involve   the treatment of cardiac failure. Their utility results from an increased cardiacoutput by increasing the force of   contraction. By increasing intracellular calcium stores   the cardiac glycosides increase calcium-induced calcium release and thus contraction. Digoxin works by binding to and inhibiting the Na^+^K^+^ -ATPase. 
#### Digitalis Poisoning
In 1785 Dr. William Withering of Birmingham wrote, "The Foxglovewhen given in very large and quickly repeated   doses, occasions sickness, vomiting, purging, giddiness,   confused vision, objects appearing green or yellow;   increased secretion of urine, with frequent motions to part with it, and sometimes inability to retain it; slow pulse, even as slow as 35 in a minute, cold sweats, convulsions, syncope, death. I am doubtful whether it does not sometimesexcite a copious flow of saliva.” 
#### Clinical description
Signs and symptoms of acute digitalis (digoxin or digitoxin) poisoning by ingestion include primarily gastrointestinal effects (nausea and vomiting), hyperkalemia, and cardiovascular effects (bradydysrhythmias [heart rate <60 or atrioventricular block] or tachydysrhythmias [ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation or atrial tachycardia with 2:1 block])

## Question 2: 
Describe a neuronal action potential and the role of myelin in neuronal signalling.
- neuronal action potential definition: a brief all-or-none depolarization or repolarization of the membrane which reverses polarity in the neuron; has a threshold (a voltage it must attain to continue transmitting electrical signal) and refactory period (a period during which it can't respond)
- role of myelin in neuronal signalling: insulates neuron's axon, speeding up conductivity and transmission of electricl impulses

What role might de-myelination play in disease? 
- de-myelination would mean neurons would lose the insulation around their axons, slowing down or even stopping conductivity and transmission of electrical impulses

### In your discussion consider:
- The physiological role of myelin.
    - role of myelin: insulates neuron's axon, speeding up conductivity and transmission of electricl impulses
### Information for Question #2
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to be an auto-immunemediated disease in which the nerves of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) degenerate. In   multiplesclerosis, inflammation causes degradation of the myelin sheath. In addition, the nerves themselves are damaged. As more and more nerves are affected, a person experiences aprogressive interference with functions that are controlled by the nervous system such as vision,   speech, walking, writing, and memory. About 350,000 people in the U.S. have multiple sclerosis. Usually, a person is   diagnosed with multiple sclerosis between 20 and 50 years of age, but multiple sclerosis has been diagnosed in   children  and in the elderly. Multiple sclerosis is twice as likely to occur in Caucasians as in anyother group. Women are twice   as likely as men to be affected by multiple sclerosis earlier in life.

## Question 3: 
Describe the sequence of events at the neuromuscular junction and how they initiate the skeletal muscle action potential. 
1. action potential arrives at axon terminal
2. membrane depolarization leads to opening of voltage-gated calcium channels and calcium entry into the axon terminal
3. leads to fusion of ACh containing vesicles and ACh release into synaptic cleft
4. ACh finds nicotinic receptors and binds
5. ligand-gated ion channel opens allowing Na^+^ entry, causing a graded depolarization
7. the graded depolarization typically exceeds threshold for nearby voltage-gate Na^+^ and K^+^ channels, so an action potential occurs in the muscle fiber
9. acetylcholinesterase enzyme breaks down ACh, when ACh no longer bound to receptors in ion channels in the muscle fiber close and the membrane returns to resting potential

How might this be affected in Myasthenia Gravis?
- as myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease involving the body attacking ACh nicotinic receptors, the events of a neuromuscular junction will not complete properly
    - ACh will have a harder time finding nicotinic receptors to bind to, which means the trigger opening ligand-gated ion channels is faulty
    - diffusion of sodium and potassium ions into the intracellular matrix will not occur as easily, and so graded and action potentials will not either

### In your discussion consider:
- What is the physiological role of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the NMJ? 
    - The physiological role of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is mediating the transduction of signals in the nervous system. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor does this by opening an ion channel for the movement of Na^+^, K^+^, and Ca^2+^ ions between the intracellular and extracellular matrices by the neuromuscular junction.
- How does acetylcholine induce activation of the skeletal muscle?
    - Acetylcholine binding to acetylcholine repectors in skeletal muscle fibers results in the opening of ligand-gated Na^+^ channels. Na^+^ ions move from the extracellular to intracellular matrix, triggering contraction.
### Information for Question #3
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder in which the body “attacks” the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Myasthenia gravis causes weakness in voluntary (skeletal) muscles. The muscle weakness can lead to a variety of symptoms, including: 
- Breathing difficulty because of weakness of the chest wall muscles
- Chewing or swallowing difficulty, causing frequent gagging, choking, or drooling
- Difficulty climbing stairs, lifting objects, or rising from a seated position
- Difficulty talking
- Drooping head
- Facial paralysis or weakness of the facial muscles
- Fatigue
- Hoarseness or changing voice
- Double vision
- Difficulty maintaining steady gaze
- Eyelid drooping
