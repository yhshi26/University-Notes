1.	What is the difference between genotype and phenotype? 
Genotype: an organism’s complete inherited set of genes, constant throughout lifetime
Phenotype: the observable traits expressed by an organism resulting from transcription, can change over time

2.	Sketch a basic mammalian cell and label the key organelles and features that are involved with protein production.
 

3.	Why do eukaryotic cells require a nucleus as a separate compartment when prokaryotic cells can manage perfectly well without?
Prokaryotic cells lack a true nucleus as their nucleoid regions are not membrane-bound. They can manage perfectly well as they still have genetic information in the form of DNA concentrated in part of the cell and can perform transcription and translation simultaneously. 
Eukaryotic cells on the other hand require a membrane-bound nucleus as it is evolutionarily advantageous for eukaryotes to compartmentalize genetic information. Doing that means an infection reaching the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell will not directly reach the site of transcription and will need to pass another barrier to do so. This leads eukaryotic cells to be less susceptible to viruses than prokaryotic cells. As well, eukaryotic cells carry out more complex processes, and need to splice introns during transcription unlike prokaryotic cells. Having a compartmentalized nucleus makes these processes possible.

4.	What if any are the advantages of being multicellular?
Multicellularity has many advantages including: 
-	increased maximum cell size (they can grow more);
-	increased protection, less likely to be engulfed
-	extended lifespan (a single cell dying does not necessarily cause organism death, which would be the case with a unicellular organism);
-	increased diversity, facilitating evolution (a result of sexual reproduction)
-	and increased complexity (multiple cells means differentiation is possible).

5.	Why does the mitochondrion have both an inner and outer membrane?
According to the endosymbiotic theory, the inner membrane of mitochondria was at some point an energy-producing prokaryotic cell. This cell was engulfed by what would be the outer membrane of the mitochondria after time and evolution. The outer membrane isolated the inner, serving as a selective barrier, while the inner membrane produced energy. This symbiotic relationship was evolutionarily advantageous and is why we have mitochondria with both an inner and outer membrane today. 

6.	Suggest a reason why it would be advantageous for eukaryotic cells to evolve elaborate internal membrane systems that allow them to import substances from the outside
With elaborate internal membrane systems, eukaryotic cells have the advantage of being able to import and store food. Larger molecules are transported into the cell via vesicles. This allows eukaryotic cells to manage production and use of energy more efficiently. Elaborate internal membrane systems allow for eukaryotic cells to also have a specialized immune system. 

7.	Discuss the following statement “The differences between a channel and a transporter are like the differences between a bridge and a ferry.”
In this analogy, the channel is comparable with a bridge and the transporter is comparable with a ferry. A bridge allows vehicles to travel from one location to another. Likewise, cell channels allow the passage of extracellular and intracellular particles in and out the cell. On the other hand, a ferry carries people and cargo from one location to another. In the same way, a cell transporter binds to a substrate and moves it in or out the cell.

8.	Electron micrographs show that mitochondria in heart muscle have a much higher density of cristae than mitochondria in skin cells. Suggest an explanation for this observation.  
Cardiac muscle cells require and expend more energy than epithelial cells, and hence require more ATP production. Having a higher density of cristae means cardiac muscle cells have a greater surface area within their mitochondria to facilitate more energy production.

9.	Why do eukaryotic cells and especially animal cells have such large and complex cytoskeletons?
Eukaryotic cells have large and complex cytoskeletons to provide more structure, support, resistance to tearing, motility, scaffolding, and assistance in mitosis (cytokinesis).
