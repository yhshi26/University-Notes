> 4 types of cells: epithelial, connective, neuronal, muscular
> This lecture will cover epithelial cells

## Epithelial tissue 
Found as the lining and covering of organs and body cavities, the secretory parts of organs and glands, the transport membranes of capillaries and alveolar sacs, and membranes which lubricate organs
- **Function:** 
    - acts as an interface between different biological compartments
    - selective secretion and absorption of ions and organic molecules
    - protection
- surface epithelia form continuous sheets comprising 1+ layers
- closely bound to one another via cell junctions

### Epithelium is named according to structure, arrangement and shape
#### Shape:
1. squamous: thin, flat cells
2. cuboidal: cube-shaped cells
3. columnar: column-shaped cells
#### Structure and arrangement:
1. simple: 1 layer thick
2. stratified: multi-layered
3. pseudostratified: appears stratified, but isn't
4. transitional: stretchable
5. ciliated: has hair-like cilia

### Lumen
- a lumen (latin for opening or light) (pl. lumina) is the inside space or lining of a tubular structure (e.g. artery, vein, GI tract)
- cells on the luminal surface often contain specialized projections (e.g. cilia)
    ##### Basal lamina (basement membrane): a layer of extracellular proteins epithelial cells rest on, anchoring the tissue
    - supporting the basal surface of the cell
    - composed of collagen, laminin and other macromolecules 
        - glycosaminoglycan
            - heparan sulphate (perlecan)
        - fibrous protein
            - collagen type IV
        - structural glycoproteins
            - firbonectin (produced by fibroblasts)
            - laminin
            - entactin
    - provides adhesive site for integrin molecules in the plasma membrane of epithelial cells - linking cell with extracellular matrix

### Structural polarity: allows for different functions
- most epithelial cells have an organisation top to bottom → polarity
    - side of the lumen is considered upper part → apical membrane
    - opposite side of lumen is considered lower part (in contact with basal lamina) → basal membrane
    - the membrane joining apical and basal membrane → lateral membrane

### Within epithelia are epithelial cells with different functions

## Intercellular surfaces
> cell junctions allow epithelia to form a continuous cohesive layer, enabling cells to communicate and cooperate in order to function
- epithelial cells are tightly joined through lateral membranes to form a barrier (one of its main functions)
- epithelium is joined to the basal lamina through specific structures 

#### Membrane junctions
> many cells are physically joined at discrete locations along their membranes by 3 main specialized types of junctions that provide mechanical strength and are associated to cytoskeleton
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/YdftFy9.png =300x)

| type     | function |
| -------- | -------- | 
| tight junctions | seals adjacent cells together, acts as barrier between inter and extracellular matrices | 
| adherens junction | joins an actin bundle in one cell to a similar bundle in a neighboring cell |
| desmosome | joins the intermediate filaments in 1 cell to those in a neighbor |
| gap junction | forms channels that allow small water-soluble molecules, including ions, to pass from cell to cell |
| hemidesmosome | anchors intermediate filaments in a cell to the basal lamina |


#### Tight junctions (occluding junctions)
- connects 2 adjacent plasma membranes to seal cells in epithelium 
- located beneath the luminal surface at the apical end of simple columnar epithelia
- the tight junction occurs in a band or zonule around the entire circumference of the cell, literally **stitching the membranes together**
    - **form the zonula occludens** (electron mic)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/ONXeC16.png =300x)
- tight junctions form barriers **(made of proteins: ocludin and claudin mainly, actin)** that limit movement of material between cells (e.g. epithelium lining gut and bladder)
    - **thus, they form a barrier to solute diffusion**
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/0LuZQV5.png =300x)

#### Adherens junctions
- anchors 2 adjacent cells together
- consist of cahderin proteins that mediate interactions
    - connected to actin via a series of proteins in the cytoplasmic face
- located beneath the tight junction (zonula occludens), **form continuous band**
- work like velcro (membranes are not touching each other)
- **form the zonula adherens** (electron mic)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/s8xavZ1.png =350x)
- link to actin which is potentially contractile, gives epithelial sheet the ability to change shape (important in embryo development: e.g. neuronal tube formation)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/yvhJVqY.png =200x)
    ##### Cancer and metastasis (spread of cancerous cells)
    - changes in the ability of cells to adhere to another can promote metastasis
    - E-cadherin = prominent cell adhesion molecule of epithelial cell
        - as E-cadherin levels increase, cell metastatic potentials decrease
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/aDvcThK.png =250x)

#### Desmosomes
- allows communication between 2 adjacent cells
- formed of **cadherins proteins (desmoglein and desmocollin)** and **interaellular linker proteins (plakoglobin and desmoplakin)** that connect 2 adjacent cells with plasma membranes separated by about **20nm**
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/WRVDMrS.png =170x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/8JvvMZ2.png =170x)
- accumulations of "dense plaques" protein along the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membran serve as anchoring points for the cadherins
- hold adjacent cells firmly together in areas that are subject to considerable stretching (e.g. skin or cardiac muscle), and connect cells via their microfilaments
    ##### Structural organization
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/m0B2Dq7.png =250x)
    - structured like rivets (rivet cells together)
    - E-cadherins interlocking, gives lots of strength
    ##### Associated disease: phemphigus vulgarus
    - autoimmune disorder: anti-desmoglein antibodies breakdown desmosomes

#### Junctional complexes
> tight junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes

![](https://i.imgur.com/QcYek7C.jpg =400x)

#### Gap junctions (communication)
- formed of protein channels linking adjacent cells
    - proteins known as **connexins** from the 2 membranes join, forming small protein-lined channels to link them (connexins can group up, forming **connexons**)
    - the diameter of these channels is small **(1.5nm)**, limiting what can pass between the cytosols of connected cells 
        - only small molecules and ions
        - no large proteins
- a variety of cell types have gap junctions 
    - e.g. muscle cells of heart, where they play an important role in transmitting electrical activity between cells
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/U1g2YiY.png =250x)
    ##### Gap can be between 2-4nm
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/9tgTVuR.png =250x)

#### Hemidesmosome
- anchors basal surface of cell (via its keratin filaments) to basal lamina
- formed of **integrin proteins** that connect cells to basal lamina
    - the extracellular domains of integrins that mediate the adhesion bind to laminin protein in basal lamina
    - the intracellular domains of integrins bind to keratin intermediate filaments via **plectin**
