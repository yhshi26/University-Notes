## Joints:

**Joint:** site of articulation between bones

### Synovial joints:

- motion and flexibility
- contains synovial fluid
    
    **Characteristic features:**
    
    - cartilage covering articulating surfaces
        - articular hyaline cartilage
    - joint capsule

#### Joint capsule:

- synovial membrane
    - attaches at margin of joint surfaces between cartilage and bone
    - produces synovial fluid
    - synovial bursae/tendon sheaths
- fibrous membrane
    - surrounds and stabilizes joint
    - parts of fibrous membrane may thicken to form ligaments
- articular disks, fat pads, tendons
- ligaments
    - attach bone to bone
- tendons
    - attach muscle to bone

#### Synovial joints permit extensive movement

#### Synovial joints:

- can be described based on shape and movement
    
    **Movement:**
    
    - uniaxial: movement in 1 plane
    - biaxial: movement in 2 planes
    - multiaxial: movement in 3 planes
    
    **Shape:**

### Synovial joint shapes:

**Plane:**

- articular surfaces are flat so bones slide over each other; permit gliding or sliding movements
- acromioclavicular (AC) joint

**Hinge:**

- resembles door hinge; permits flexion and extension
- elbow joint, interphalangeal (IP) joints

**Ball and socket:**

- rounded head fits into a concavity; permits widest range of motion in several axes
- shoulder (glenohumeral) joint

**Saddle:**

- reciprocally concave/convex articular surfaces; permits flexion/extension and ab/adduction
- at thumb between metacarpal 1 and trapezium

**Pivot:**

- rounded process of bone rotates around central axis within a ligamentous ring or sleeve; permits rotation
- radius rotating on ulna at proximal/distal radioulnar joints

**Ellipsoid/condyloid:**

- 2 curved bones fit together; convex surface of 1 bone articulates with concave surface of another; permits flexion/extension, ab/adduction, circumduction
- wrist (radiocarpal joint)
- metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints of fingers
    
    (note: some classification systems make a distinction between ellipsoid and condyloid joints)
    

## Articulations of the pectoral girdle and shoulder:

![](https://i.imgur.com/Y5DqUZM.jpg =400x)

- articulation of clavicle with axial skeleton (trunk)
    - sternoclavicular joint
- articulation of clavicle and scapula with each other
    - acromioclavicular joint
- movements at the sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular and shoulder (glenohumeral) joints give the upper limb its freedom of movement
    
    
    **Sternoclavicular (SC) joint:**

    - articulating surfaces:
        - clavicle
        - manubrium of sternum
        - cartilage of 1st rib
    - saddle type of synovial joint
    - movements
        - gliding
    - articular capsule
    - ligaments
        - anterior sternoclavicular ligament
            - clavicle to anterior surface of manubrium
        - posterior sternoclavicular ligament
            - between posterior surfaces of clavicle and manubrium
        - interclavicular ligament
            - joins the superior surface of 2 clavicles across sternal notch
            - limits depression of shoulder
        - costoclavicular ligament
            - from 1st costal cartilage to inferior  surface clavicle
            - limits elevation of shoulder
        - articular disk
            - between sternum & clavicle
            - allows clavicle and manubrium to slide over each other
    - blood supply
        - internal thoracic and suprascapular arteries
    - innervation
        - branches from nerve to subclavius
    - movements
        - very stable joint
        - strong joint capsule
        - strong ligamentous support
    - large degree of mobility
        - elevation, depression
            - shrugging shoulders
        - protraction, retraction
            - reaching for an object
            - ![](https://i.imgur.com/P77uRpE.png =300x)
    - SC dislocation is rare
        - significant force/trauma
        - clavicle fractures rather than SC joint dislocation
        - costoclavicular ligament & articular disc transfer forces to sternum

**Acromioclavicular (AC) joint:**

- articulating surfaces
    - clavicle
    - acromion of scapula
- plane type of synovial joint
- movements
    - gliding, rotation of scapula on clavicle
- ligaments
    - articular capsule
    - superior acromioclavicular ligament
        - covers joint superiorly
    - inferior acromioclavicular ligament
        - covers joint inferiorly
    - coracoclavicular ligament
        - comprised of trapezoid and conoid ligaments
    - articular disk
- blood supply
    - supraclavicular and thoracoacromial arteries
- innervation
    - branches from lateral pectoral & suprascapular nerves
- movements
    - allows scapula to move on the lateral end clavicle by rotating on 2 axes
    - allows a degree of axial rotation and anteroposterior movement
- injuries
    - commonly dislocated in contact sports (separated shoulder → misnomer)
        - separated shoulder = AC joint separation, not to be confused with shoulder dislocation
    - direct blow to joint
    - fall on outstretched hand (FOOSH)
    - serious injury – rupture of ligaments
        - acromioclavicular or coracoclavicular
        - reconstruction
    - injury classification of the acromioclavicular joint:

**Glenohumeral (shoulder) joint:**

- synovial, ball and socket type joint
- articulations:
    - head of humerus with glenoid cavity of scapula
- articular surfaces covered by hyaline cartilage
