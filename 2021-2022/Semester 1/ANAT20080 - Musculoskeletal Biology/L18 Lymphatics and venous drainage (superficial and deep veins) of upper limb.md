## Lymphatic system
- lymphatic system drains tissue fluid, plasma membranes and cellular debris back into blood stream
    - lymph is filtered by lymph nodes and directed to venous system
    - role in immune defence
- lymphatic plexuses around hand

### Lymphatics
- superficial lymphatic vessels of upper limb initially arise from lymphatic plexuses in the hand
    - ascend in the arm adjacent to major superficial veins: basilic and cephalic veins
- deep lymphatic vessels of upper limb follow major deep veins
    - function to drain lymph from joint capsules, periosteum, tendons and muscles

### Lymph nodes
- axillary lymph nodes
    - **pectoral (anterior)** 3-5 nodes in medial wall of axilla
    - **subscapular (posterior)** 6-7 nodes along posterior axillary fold
    - **humeral (lateral)** 4-6 nodes in lateral wall of axilla
    - **central** 3-4 large nodes in fat at base of axilla
    - **apical** located in apex of axilla lateral border of 1st rib

## Venous system of upper limb
- the venous system of upper limb drains deoxygenated blood from arm, forearm and hand
- divided into **superficial veins** and **deep veins**
- perforating veins run between deep and superficial veins connecting the two systems
- diagrams: palmar digital veins, dorsal venous plexuses

### Superficial veins:
- cephalic vein:
    - origin: lateral side of dorsal venous plexus of hand
    - termination: axillary vein
- basilic vein:
    - origin: medial side of dorsal venous plexus of hand
    - termination: axillary vein
- median cubital vein:
    - origin: cephalic vein near cubital fossa
    - termination: basilic vein
- axillary vein:
    - lies medial to axillary artery in the axilla
    - axillary sheath encloses axillary vein, artery and brachial plexus cords
- subclavian vein

#### Cephalic vein
- arises from **dorsal venous network** of hand
- ascends anterolaterally throughout upper limb
- at elbow: cephalic vein passes anteriorly
- at shoulder: cephalic vein travels into **deltopectoral groove** (indentation between deltoid and pectoralis major muscles)
- enters axillary region via clavipectoral triangle
- terminates within axilla by joining **axillary vein**

##### Clavipectoral triangle
- also known as deltopectoral triangle
- anatomical space bounded by:
    - superior border pectorais major
    - anterior border deltoid
    - clavicle
- contains: cephalic vein, deltopectoral fascia and deltoid branch of thoracoacromial artery

#### Basilic vein
- arises from **dorsal venous network of hand**
- ascends medial aspect of upper limb
- basilic vein moves deep into arm
- terminates by uniting with **pared brachial veins** to continue as axillary vein

#### Mean cubital vein
- at elbow, cepahlic and basilic veins connect via **median cubital vein**

#### Axillary vein
- axillary vein is continuation of **basilic vein** (same borders as axillary artery in reverse)
- lies medial to axillary artery in axilla
- cephalic vein passes **deltopectoral groove** and drains into axillary vein in axilla
- **axillary sheath** encloses cords of brachial plexus, axillary artery and vein

### Deep veins
- underneath deep fascia of upper limb
- brachial veins
    - large paired veins
    - situated either side of brachial artery
    - pulsations of brachial artery aid venous return
    - **venae comitantes** (latin for accompanying veins)

## Clinical notes
- lymphogenic spread of breast cancer: in breast cancer, axillary lymph nodes may be biopsied or removed (axillary clearance) to prevent metastatic growth
- subclavian vein for central line placement to administer nutritional and medicaiton fluids
- venipuncture: median cubital vein
- **venous cutdown**
    - emergency method of achieving vascular access when other techniques and equipment unavailable
        - shock patients
    - largely **replaced by alternative methods** of venous access in trauma medicine
    - common sites for venous cutdown:
        - basilic vein above elbow
            - predictable anatomical location
            - consistently found 2 cm above and 2-3 cm lateral to medial epicondyle on anterior surface of upper arm
        - cephalic vein below elbow
    - procedure:
        - venous tourniquet placed proximal to cut-down site
        - carefully identify cut-down site and inject local anaesthetic along intended incision line if patient conscious
        - make transverse incision through skin avoiding damage to underlying vein
        - spread skin (curved haemostat) and isolate vein lying at right angle to line of incision

        - place 2 ligatures (threads or suture material) under vein proximally and distally
        - tie off distal vein
        - between the 2 ligatures, carefully cut half-way through vein
        - slip IV catheter through opening aiming into proximal side towards heart
        - secure by tying proximal ligature
        - release touniquet
        - suture skin together to hold in position
