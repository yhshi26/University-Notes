### Arterial supply
- the arterial supply to upper limb begins with **subclavian arteries**
    - right subclavian artery comes from **brachiocephalic trunk**
    - left subclavian comes from **arch of aorta**
- the subclavian arteries cross lateral border of 1st rib and become **axillary arteries**

### Scapular anastomosis
- arterial system connecting subclavian and axillary arteries forming circulatory anastomosis around scapula

### Scapular region
- many arteries found in posterior scapular region:
    - suprascapular artery
    - circumflex scapular artery
    - thoracodorsal artery
    - dorsal scapular artery
- these contribuet to an interconnected vascular network around the scapula

#### Suprascapular artery
- originates base of neck
- suprascapular artery can arise:
    - directly from subclavian artery or
    - indirectly via thyrocervical trunk
- enters posterior scapular region superior to suprascapular notch
    - suprascapular nerve runs through notch
- enters supraspinous fossa running between scapula and suprasinous muscle
- descends to reach infraspinous fossa
    - supplies supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles
- supplies many structures along its course
    - sends articular branches to AC and shoulder joints

#### Circumflex scapular artery
- branch of subscapular artery
    - subscapular artery originates from 3rd part of axillary artery
- the circumflex scapular artery enters the posterior scapular region
    - passing through origin of teres minor muscle
- forms anastomotic connections with other arteries in the region

#### Thoracodorsal artery
- branch of subsapular arter
    - subscapular artery originates from 3rd part of axillary artery
- the thoracodorsal artery continues the course of the subscapular artery
    - descends with thoracodorsal nerve to latissimus dorsi muscle

#### Dorsal scapular artery
- branch of the subclavian artery
- enters posterior scapular region
    - passing through trunks of brachial plexus, deep to levator scapulae to reach superior scapular angle
- descends under rhomboids along medial border of scapular to inferior angle
- supplies rhomboids, lat. dorsi and trapezius
![](https://i.imgur.com/dYrqkQF.png =250x)

#### Axillary artery
- the subclavian artery in the neck continues as the **axillary artery**
    - supplies walls of axilla and related regions
- starts at lateral border of 1st rib
- passes through axilla
- ends at lateral border of teres major
    - becomes **brachial artery**
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/U6MtDXV.png =350x)
- divided into 3 parts by pectoralis minor
    - axillary artery passes posterior to pectoralis minor muscle
    1. first part:
        - proximal to pec. minor
        - lateral margin of 1st rib to upper border of pec. minor
    2. second part:
        - posterior to pec. minor
    3. third part:
        - distal to pec. minor
        - lower border of pec. minor to termination at teres major
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/klWjQ6l.png =350x)
- generally, six branches arise from axillary artery
    - remember: 1 from 1, 2 from 2, 3 from 3
    - remember: "Send The Lord to Say A Prayer"
    1. first part: 1 branch (superior thoracic artery)
    2. second part: 2 branches (thoracoacromial and lateral thoracic arteries)
    3. third part: 3 branches (subscapular, anterior circumflex humeral and posterior circumflex humeral arteries)
- the axillary artery becomes the **brachial artery**
    - at the lateral border of teres major
    - main source of blood for the arm
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/wMWshCs.png =250x)

#### Brachial artery
- found in anterior compartment
- begins as continuation of **axillary artery** at lateral border of teres major
- terminates just distal to elbow joint
    - bifurcates into radial and ulnar arteries
- gives off several branches
    - 2 ulnar collateral vessels
        - contribute to network of arteries around elbow joint
    - the profunda brachii artery
    - nutrient arteries to humerus
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/Nu5zYJk.png =250x)
- brachial artery descends into arm posterior to **median nerve**
- in proximal arm, lies on medial side
- in distal arm, moves laterally midway between lateral epicondyle and medial epicondyle of humerus
- crosses anterior to elbow joint
- as it crosses **cubita fossa** underneath brachialis
    - bifurcates into **radial and ulnar arteries**
- brachial artery gives rise to **profunda brachii** (deep artery of arm)
    - largest branch of brachial artery
        - posterior surface of humerus in **radial groove**
        - supplies structures in posterior arm
        - terminates at elbow joint

## Forearm arterial supply
- the **radial artery** supplies the posterior aspect of the forearm
- the **ulnar artery** supplies the anterior aspect of the forearm

### Radial artery
- originates from brachial artery at neck of radius
- passes along lateral aspect of forearm
- in distal forearm, radial artery can be located using flexor carpi radialis msucle as landmark
    - radial pulse can be felt by gently palpating radial artery against underlying muscle and bone
- the radial artery leaves the forearm
- passes around lateral side of wrist
- penetrates posterolateral aspect of hand between metacarpals I and II
- branches of the radial artery in hand provide major blood supply to thumb and lateral side of index finger
![](https://i.imgur.com/P556a1T.png =250x)
- other branches of radial artery originating in forearm include:
    - radial recurrent artery
        - contributes to an anastomotic network around elbow joint
    - a small palmar carpal branch
        - contributes to an anastromotic network of vessels supplying carpal bones and joints
    - a larger superficial palmar branch
        - enters hand by passing through thenar muscles at base of thumb

### Ulnar artery
- larger than radial artery
- passes down medial side of forearm
- passes through forearm in fascial plane between flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum profundus muscles
- the ulnar artery enters hand by passing lateral to the pisiform bone and superficial to the flexor retinaculum of wrist
- major blood supply to medial 3 1/2 digits
![](https://i.imgur.com/W6DsNp9.png =350x)
- branches of ulnar artery that arise in forearm include:
    - **ulnar recurrent artery** with anterior and posterior branches, which contribute to an anastomotic network of vessels around elbow joint
    - numerous **muscular arteries** which supply surrounding muscles
    - **common interosseous artery** which divides into anterior and posterior interosseous arteries
    - 2 small **carpal arteries** (dorsal carpal branch and palmar carpal branch) which supply wrist
    
### Posterior compartment forearm
- the blood supply to the posterior compartment of the forearm occurs predominantly through branches of the radial, posterior interosseous and anterior interosseous arteries

## Hand arterial supply

### Palmar hand
- radial and ulnar arteries form two interconnected vascular arches
    - superficial palmar arch
    - deep palmar arch
- vessels to the digits, muscle and joints originate from the two arches and the parent arteries
- **radial artery:** thumb and lateral side of index finger
- **ulnar artery:** medial side of index finger and remaining digits

![](https://i.imgur.com/W2tx5r0.png =250x)

### Dorsum of hand
- dorsal carpal arch
    - radial artery
    - anastomosis with ulnar artery
        - dorsal carpal branch
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/4ica6oQ.png =200x)

## Etc.

### Pulse points
![](https://i.imgur.com/70XZK9w.png =350x)

### Allens test
- allens test:
    - tests adequate anastomoses between radial and ulnar arteries
- compress both radial and ulnar arteries at wrist
- patient asked to open and close hand into first while arteries compressed; hand appears blanched/pallor
- release pressure from each artery in turn and determine filling pattern of hand (observe colour change)
- coloration returns within few seconds in ulnar and radial arteries are patent
- **arterial insufficiency = pallor persists**

### Axillary artery aneurysm
- an aneurysm is dilation of a blood vessel to more than double original size
- dilated protion of axillary artery can compress **brachial plexus** producing neurological symptoms such as paresthesia and muscle weakness
- surgery required to remove aneurysm and reconstruct vessel wall

### Occlusion or laceration of brachial artery
- if artery completely blocked or severed, it is a medical emergency
- resulting ischaemia of forearm can cause necrosis
- paralysis of muscles in forearm: affected muscles are replaced by scar tissue and shorted considerably
- this can cause characteristic flexion deformity: **volkmann's ischaemic contracture**
