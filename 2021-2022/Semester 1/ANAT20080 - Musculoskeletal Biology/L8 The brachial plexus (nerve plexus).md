## Brachial plexus
- mahor nerve network (plexus) of upper limb
- functions in conducting signals from spine to shoulder, arm and hand
    - supplies motor and sensory innervation to upper limb and pectoral girdle
- begins in neck and extends into axilla posterior to clavicle
- formed by lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal nerves

### Spinal nerves
- spinal nerve forms from posterior (sensory) and anterior (motor) roots
- posterior and anterior roots join to form a spinal nerve
- each spinal nerve divides into
    - posterior ramus
    - anterior ramus
    - **anterior rami: anterior divisions of spinal nerves**
    - **brachial plexus: anterior rami of C5, C6, C7, C8, T1**
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/YTXuAuq.png =250x)
- within nerve plexus, fibres from the various anterior rami branch and redistribute
    - each nerve exiting the plexus has fibres from several different spinal nerves
    - damage to a single spinal nerve will not completely paralyze a limb

### Structure
- roots
    - anterior rami of C5 to T1
- trunks
    - C5 and C6 roots join to form the **superior trunk** of the plexus
    - the **middle trunk** is a continuation of the C7 root
    - the **inferior trunk** is formed by the union of C8 and T1 roots
- divisions
    - each trunk divides into an anterior and posterior **division**
        - as plexus passes through the cervicoaxillary canal posterio to the clavicle
- cords
    - the three posterior divisions join to form the **posterior cord**
        - contains contributions from all roots C5 to T1
    - the anterior divisions of the superior and middle trunks join to form the **lateral cord**
        - contains contributions from roots C5 to C7
    - the anterior division of the inferior trunk forms the **medial cord**
        - contains contributions from roots C8 to T1
    - cords are related to the second part of the axillary artery
    - named according to their postition in relation to axillary artery
- terminal branches
    - the products of plexus formation are multisegmental peripheral named nerves

### Relation of brachial plexus to axillary artery

## Posterior triangle of the neck
- **roots** of the plexus usually pass through the posterior triangle of the neck
- gap between: middle scalene, anterior scalene, first rib

### Branches from roots
- the roots of the brachial plexus give rise to:
- **long thoracic**
    - originates from anterior rami C5 to C7
    - passes vertically down neck and medial wall axilla
    - serratus anterior
- **dorsal scapular**
    - originates from C5 root
    - passes posteriorly piercing middle scalene to travel along medial border of scapula
    - rhomboids, levator scapulae

### Branches from trunks
- the only branches airising from trunks originate from the superior (upper) trunk of the brachial plexus
- **nerve to subclavius**
    - passes anteroinferiorly over subclavian artery and vein
    - subclavius
- **suprascapular**
    - passes laterally through posterior triangle of neck, deep to trapezius to enter supraspinous fossa through suprascapular notch
    - supraspinatus and infraspinatus

### Branches from lateral cord of brachial plexus
- **lateral pectoral**
    - most proximal branch from lateral cord
    - passes anteriorly together with thoracoacromial artery to penetrate clavipectoral fascia
    - pectoralis major
- **musculocutaneous nerve**
    - large terminal branch
    - passes laterally to penetrate coracobrachialis and pass between biceps brachii and brachialis in arm
    - terminates as the lateral cutaneous nerve of forearm
    - innervates all 3 flexor muscles in anterior arm: biceps brachii, brachialis, coracobrachialis
- **lateral root of median nerve**
    - largest terminal branch of lateral cord
    - passes medially to join similar branch from medial cord to form median nerve

### Branches from medial cord of brachial plexus
- medial pectoral nerve
    - pectoralis major and minor
- medial cutaneous nerve of arm
    - passes through axilla, supplies skin on medial side of distal 1/3 of arm
- medial cutaneous of forearm
    - innervates skin over biceps brachii and skin over medial forearm down to wrist
- **ulnar nerve**
    - large terminal branch of medial cord
    - passes through arm and forearm into hand
    - innervates intrinsic muscles of hand
        - note exceptions
- **medial root of median nerve**

### Branches from posterior cord of brachial plexus
- superior (upper) and inferior (lower) subscapular nerves
    - subscapularis, teres major
- thoracodorsal nerve
    - passes vertically along posterior axillary wall
    - latissismus dorsi
- **axillary nerve**
    - originates from posterior cord
    - passes inferiorly and laterally along posterior wall axilla
    - passes posteriorly around surgical neck of humerus
    - deltois and teres minor
- **radial nerve**
    - passes into posterior compartment of arm

## Clinical conditions

### Injury to long thoracic nerve
- lies on superficial aspect of serratus anterior
- susceptible to injury through direct trauma or strecth
    - blow to the ribs underneath an outstretched arm
    - damaged during surgery for breast cancer
    - stab injuries
    - carrying heavy bags over shoulder for prolonged time
- symptoms
    - a posterior shoulder or scapular burning type of pain 
- a lesion of the nerve paralyses serratus anterior
    - winged scapula
    - patient pushes an outstretched arm against a wall

### Suprascapular nerve injury
- entrapment neuropathy in suprascapular notch
- trauma to shoulder or scapula
- symptoms
    - entrapment neuropathy
        - shoulder pain
        - weakness/wasting of supraspinatus and infraspinatus
- supraspinatus SITS
    - assists deltoid in abduction of arm
- infraspinatus SITS
    - lateral rotation of humerus

### Axillary sheath
- extension of the deep cervical fascia
- encloses the 1st portion of axillary artery, vein and brachial plexus
- local anaesthetic can be injected into the space it encloses
    - anaesthetic will be retained there and the upper limb will be anaesthetised
- fractures of the radius and operations on the hand can be done under this **axillary block**

## Brachial plexus injury types
- avulsion, rupture, neuroma, neurapraxia
    - avulsion: most serious, nerve torn, permanent damage
    - rupture: nerves torn in 1 or more places but not detached, surgery can repair but damage usually permanent
    - neuroma: scar tissue around injury prevents communication with muscle (impairing movement), may require surgery to remove scar tissue
    - neuropraxia/stretch/praxis injury: nerves damaged but not torn, swelling/bruising/compression/over-stretchin, most common injury type, 90-100% return of function
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/erCuU1K.png =450x)
- obstetrical brachial plexus injury
    - result from traumatic deliveries, e.g. shoulder dystocia
        - shoulder dystocia: fetal head is delivered, but shoulders are trapped behind mother's pelvic bone
    - most brachial plexus injuries occur at birth (2-5/1000 births)
        - in many cases, child recovers full function in 1st week of life
        - if no improvement in 1st 2 weeks, recovery unlikely
        - parmanent impairement occurs in up to 25% of cases

    - tearing of root C5 and C6
    - erb-duchenne palsy (waiter's tip)

- lower plexus palsies
    - tearing of T1 root
    - klumpke paralysis
