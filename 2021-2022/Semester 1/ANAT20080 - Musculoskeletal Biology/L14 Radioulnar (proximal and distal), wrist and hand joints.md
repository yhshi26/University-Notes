### Proximal radioulnar joint
- pivot type synovial joint
- head of radius articulate with radial notch of ulna
- fibrous capsule and synovial membrane continuous with that of elbow joint
- anular ligament form osteo-ligamentous ring with radial notch of ulna
    - rotation of head of radius
- blood supply from anterior and posterior interosseous arteries
- innervation from musculocutaneous, median, radial and ulnar nerves

### Distal radioulnar joint
- pivot type synovial joint
- distal head of ulna articulates with ulnar notch of radius
- fibrous articular disc
    - from ulnar styloid to ulnar notch of radius
    - separates distal radioulnar joint from wrist joint
- fibrous capsule is attached to articular margins including fibrocartilage disc inferiorly
- blood supply and innervation provided by the anterior/posterior interosseous arteries and nerves

## Pronation/supination
- ulnar is stabilizing bone of forearm located medially
- laterally postitions radius can pivot around ulna
    - rotation of radius at elbow
    - movement of distal end of radius over ulna
    - allows rotation of hand when elbow flexed
- movement required at both proximal and distal radioulnar joints

- at the elbow:
    - the superior articular surface of the radial head spins on the capitulum
- at the same time, at the **proximal radioulnar joint:**
    - the radial head slides against the radial notch of the ulna and adjacent areas of the joint capsule and anular ligament
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/6qMU4uL.png =100x)
- at the **distal radioulnar joint:**
    - the ulnar notch of the radius slides anteriorly over the convex surface of the head of the ulna
    - because the hand articulates mainly with the radius, movement of the distal end of the radius medially over the ulna moves the hand from the palm anterior (supinated) to the palm posterior (pronated) position
- during pronation/supination movements that forearm bones are held together by:
    - the anular ligament of the radius at the proximal radioulnar joint
    - the interosseous membrane along the lengths of the radius and ulna
    - the articular disc at the distal radioulnar joint

### Muscles of supination
- two muscles supinate the hand
- supinator
    - in posterior compartment of forearm
- biceps brachii
    - supinator and flexor of elbow joint
    - most effective as a supinator when forearm flexed
- the tendon of biceps brachii and the supinator muscle both wrap around the proximal end of radius when hand pronated
- when they contract, they unwrap the bone, producing supination of the hand

### Muscles of pronation
- two muscles located in the anterior compartment of forearm pronate the hand
    - pronator teres
    - pronator quadratus
- when they contract, they pull the distal end of radius over ulna resulting in pronation of the hand

## Hand
- the hand is the region of the upper limb distal to the wrist joint
- subdivided into:
    - wrist (carpus)
    - metacarpus
    - digits
        - thumb, index, middle, ring and little fingers
- the hand had:
    - anterior surface (palm)
    - dorsal surface (dorsum)

### Bones of hand
- three groups of bones in hand:
    - 8 carpal bones
        - bones of wrist
    - 5 metacarpals (1-5, I to V)
        - boens of metacarpus
    - phalanges
        - bones of digits
        - thumb only has 2
        - other digits have 3

#### Carpal bones
- some lovers try positions that they cannot handle
    - scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, pisiform, trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, hamate
- **proximal row:**
    - scaphoid:
        - boat-shaped
        - has prominent tubercle on lateral palmar surface
    - lunate:
        - crescent shaped
    - triquetrum:
        - three-sided bone
    - pisiform:
        - pea-shaped
        - is a sesamoid bone in tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris
        - articulates with anterior surface of triquetrum
- **distal row:**
    - trapezium:
        - four-sided bone
        - articulates with metacarpal bone of thumb
    - trapezoid:
        - small irregular four-sided bone
    - capitate:
        - largest of carpal bones
        - has a head
        - articulates with base of metacarpal 3
    - hamate:
        - positioned lateral and distal to pisiform
        - has prominent hook (hook of hamate) on its palmar surface that projects anteriorly
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/ROHV1iR.png =250x)
- **articular surfaces:**
    - carpal bones have articular surfaces
    - articulate with other carpal bones
    - distal row articulates with metacarpals
    - all movements of metacarpals on carpal bones limited
        - with exception of metacarpal of thumb
    - proximal surfaces of scaphoid and lunate articulate with radius to form wrist joint

#### Wrist (radiocarpal) joint
- ellipsoid type synovial joint
    - condyloid, ovoid
- between:
    - distal end of radius
    - articular disc at distal end of ulna
    - carpal bones (scaphoid and lunate)
    - capsule
        - strengthened by ulnar and radial collateral ligaments
    - movements
        - flexion/extension
        - adduction (ulnar deviation)/abduction (radial deviation)
            - due to radial styloid process extending further, hand can be adducted to a greater degree
- **intercarpal joints:**
    - articulations of carpal bones
    - articulations of proximal row
    - articulations of distal row
    - proximal and distal rows with each other (mid-carpal joint)

- **carpal arch:**
    - the carpal bones form the carpal arch
        - medial side formed by **pisiform and hamate**
        - lateral side formed by **scaphoid and trapezium**
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/dwuTL6J.png =450x)
    - **carpal tunnel:**
        - flexor retinaculum spans between medial and lateral sides to form the anterior wall of the **carpal tunnel**
        - passing through carpal tunnel: 
            - 4 tendons of flexor digitorum profundus
            - 4 tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis
            - tendon of flexor pollicis longus
            - median nerve
        - **clinical: carpal tunnel syndrome**
            - entrapment of median nerve in carpal tunnel
            - most common nerve compression syndrome
            - precise cause unknown:
                - overuse
                - swelling of tendons and tendon sheaths (rheumatoid arthritis)
                - cysts arising from carpal joints
            - symptoms:
                - numbness
                - tingling: pins and needles
                - wasting of thenar muscles
                    - tinel's sign: tapping over median nerve (in region of flexor retinaculum) produces these symptoms
            - therapy: splinting, anti-inflammatories, surgery

#### Metacarpals
- each of five metacarpals relates to particular digit
    - thumb: metacarpal 1 (I)
    - index: metacarpal 2 (II)
    - middle: metacarpal 3 (III)
    - ring: metacarpal 4 (IV)
    - little: metacarpal 5 (V)
- base of metacarpals articulate with
    - carpal bones **(carpometacarpal joints)**
        - thumb: **saddle joint** between metacarpal 1 and trapezium, allows mobility of thumb
        - digits 2-5: limited to gliding movements
    - articulate with each other **(intermetacarpal joints)**
- heads of metacarpals articulate with
    - proximal phalanges of digits **(metacarpophalangeal joints)**
    - metacarpal heads form knuckles on dorsal surface of hand when fingers flexed
- **clinical:**
    - boxer's fracture/brawler's fracture
        - a fracture of a metacarpal bone after patient strikes an object with closed fist
        - fracture typically transversely across neck of metacarpal
        - often occurs in 4th or 5th metacarpal bones (of ring or little finger)

#### Phalanges
- thumb has 2 phalanges
    - proximal phalanx
    - distal phalanx
- other digits have 3 phalanges
    - proximal phalanx
    - middle phalanx
    - distal phalanx
- each phalanx has a
    - base, shaft (body) and head distally
- base of each proximal phalanx articulate with the head of the related metacarpal bone
- the head of each distal phalanx is non-articular
    - flattened into crescent-shaped palmar tuberosity at end of digit

## Joints

### Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints
- joints between distal heads of metacarpals and proximal phalanges of digits
- condylar (ellipsoid, ovoid) synovial joints
- movements:
    - flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, circumduction
- joint capsule reinforced by palmar ligament and medial and lateral collateral ligaments
- deep transverse metacarpal ligaments
    - connect palmar ligaments together
    - restrict movement of bones relative to each other

### Interphalangeal (IP) joints
- uniaxial hinge joints
- between base and head of phalanx bones
- movements
    - mainly flexion and extension
- reinforced by medial and lateral collateral ligaments and palmar ligaments
- distal interphalangeal joints (DIP)
- proximal interphalangeal joints (PIP)
