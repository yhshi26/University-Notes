## Glenohumeral (shoulder) joint
- synovial, ball and socket type joint
- articulations:
    - head of humerous with glenoid cavity of scapula
- articular surfaces covered by hyaline cartilage

### Scapulohumeral (intrinsic shoulder) muscles
- there are 6 scapulohumeral muscles:
    1. subscapularis
    2. supraspinatus
    3. infraspinatus
    4. teres major
    5. teres minor
    6. deltoid
- short muscles from scapula to humerous
- act on glenohumeral joint

### Rotator cuff SITS muscles
- of the scapulaohumeral muscles
    - **s**upraspinatus
    - **i**nfraspinatus
    - **t**eres minor
    - **s**ubscapularis
    - collectively known as rotator cuff or **SITS** muscles
    - function to hold humeral head in glenoid cavity of scapula
    - form musculotendinous rotator cuff around joint

#### Supraspinatus
- origin:
    - supraspinous fossa of scapula
- insertion:
    - superior facet of greater tubercle of humerus
    - through capsule of shoulder joint
        - joint capsule
        - outer fibrous membrane
        - inner synovial membrane
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/f9c4ApE.png =200x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/YzOdSIu.png =150x)
- innervation:
    - suprascapular nerve
- action:
    - aids deltoid in abduction of arm
    - stabilizes shoulder joint
    - acts with rotator cuff muscles

    - middle facet or greater tubercle of humerus
    - through capsule of shoulder joint
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/FnbDSrc.png =250x)
- innervation:
    - suprascapular nerve
- action:
    - lateral rotation of humerus
    - stabilizes shoulder joint
    - acts with rotator cuff muscles
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/mx2Usqz.png =225x)

#### Teres minor
- origin:
    - middle part of lateral border of scapula
- insertion:
    - inferior facet of greater tubercle of humerus
    - through the capsule of shoulder joint
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/sYYXwRt.png =150x)
- innervation:
    - axillary nerve
- action:
    - lateral rotation of humerus
    - stabilizes shoulder joint
    - acts with rotator cuff muscles

#### Subscapularis
- origin:
    - subscapular fossa
- insertion:
    - lesser tubercle of humerus
    - fuses with capsule of shoulder joint
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/yzuxy2Y.png =175x)
- innervation:
    - subscapular nerve
- action:
    - medial rotation of humerus

    - helps hold head of humerus in glenoid cavity

#### Rotator cuff SITS muscles
- **s**upraspinatus
- **i**nfraspinatus
- **t**eres minor
- **s**ubscapularis
- movements:
    - all except supraspinatus are **rotators** of humerous
    - supraspinatus initiates and assists deltois in **abduction** of the arm
- SITS tendons:
    - blend with and reinforce glenohumeral joint capsule
    - protect joint and confers stability

### Scapulohumeral (intrinsic shoulder) muscles
- rotator cuff SITS muscles
- teres major
- deltoid

#### Teres major
- origin:
    - posterior surface of inferior angle of scapula
    - inferior 1/3 of lateral border of scapula
- insertion:
    - medial lip of bicipital groove of humerus
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/NU7ZeFq.png =175x)
- innervation:
    - lower subscapular nerve
- action:
    - medial rotation of arm
    - adduction of arm
- palpation:
    - the abducted arm is adducted against resistance
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/EAhwz6B.png =250x)

#### Deltoid
- thick, powerful muscle covering shoulder
    - forms rouded contour of shoulders
- 3 parts
    - anterior
    - posterior
    - middle
- powerful arm abductor
    - when all 3 parts contract simultaneously, the arm is adbucted
    - assisted by supraspinatus for first 15* of abduction
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/Cdf0ite.png =250x)
- origin:
    - later 1/3 of clavicle
    - acromion
    - spine of scapula
- insertion:
    - deltoid tuberosity of humerus
- innervation:
    - axillary nerve
- action:
    - clavicular (anterior) part: flexion, medial rotation
    - acromion (middle) part: abduction
    - spinal (posterior) part: extension and lateral rotation of arm
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/MJXeNFd.png =250x)
- acts as a shunt muscle resisting downward displacement of the humerus (in lifting and carrying)
- aided by supraspinatus in initial 15* abduction
- clavicular (anterior) and spinal (posterior) parts flex and extend at the shoulder joint during walking
    - swinging limbs during walking
- common site for intramuscular injections (note location of axillary nerve)
- axillary nerve damage

## Shoulder (glenohumeral) joint
- most mobile joint in body
    - flexion/extension
    - abduction/adduction
    - medial and lateral rotation
    - circumduction
- relative lack of bony constraints around joint
- surrounding muscular and soft tissues provide some joint stability
- most frequently dislocated joint

### Glenoid labrum
- fibrocartilage rim around glenoid fossa
- attached to edges of the glenoid cavity
- functions to **deepen** the glenoid cavity
- protects against shoulder dislocation
![](https://i.imgur.com/HB8JdBH.png =250x)

### Articular capsule
- from edge of glenoid cavity and glenoid labrum
- to anatomical neck of humerus
- laxity of joint capsule permits high degree of mobility (particularly for adbuction)
- strengthened by muscle tendons and glenohumeral bands of ligaments
    - anterioly: subscapular muscle
    - posterioly: teres minor and infraspinatus
    - superioly: supraspinatus
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/aQYFDmm.png =250x)
    
### Ligaments
- coracohumeral
    - coracoid process to greater tubercle
    - stabilises joint superiorly
- transverse humeral
    - bridges the intertubercular groove
    - holds tendon of long head of biceps brachii in bicipital groove
- glenohumeral
    - 3 ligaments representing thickenings of the anterior portion of the articular capsule
    - stabilise joint anteriorly
        - superior
        - middle
        - inferior
    - pass from superomedial margin of glenoid cavity to the lesser tubercle and anatomical neck of humerus
![](https://i.imgur.com/HtryUsy.png =250x)

### Joint stability
- coracoacromial arch superiorly
    - acromion, coracoid process, coracoacromial ligament
        - coracoacromial ligament runs between the acromion and coracoid process of the scapula
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/vpfdkXN.png =250x)
- tendons of rotator cuff (SITS)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/K8Jocc1.png =150x)
    - blend with joint capsule forming musculotendinous collar or cuff
    - hold the humeral head in the glenoid cavity when the capsuloligamentous structures are lax
- tendon of long head of biceps brachii
    - restricts upward movement of the humeral head on glenoid cavity
        - tendon passes superiorly through the joint

### Synovial membrane
- lines the inside of the capsule and attaches to margins of the articular surfaces
- loose inferiorly to accommodate abduction of arm
- protrusions form bursae
- reduces friction between the tendons adjacent joint capsule and bone
- **subtendinous bursa of subscapularis**
- **intertubercular synovial sheath**
![](https://i.imgur.com/8vO6EUs.png =250x)
- **subacromial or subdeltoid bursa**
    - between acromion or deltoid and supraspinatus tendon
    - inflammation fo this bursa can cause severe shoulder problems
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/BMGpfV7.png =250x)

### Vascular supply and innervation
- vascular supply from circumflex humeral arteries and branches of axillary and suprascapular arteries
- innervated by small branches from the axillary, subscapular, musculocutaenous, pectoral and suprascapular nerves
![](https://i.imgur.com/06jhfiN.png =250x)

### Clinical notes
- shoulder dislocation
    - displacement of the humeral head from glenoid cavity
    - rotator cuff stabilises shoulder joint
    - weakest part **inferiorly and anteriorly** susceptible to dislocation
    - humeral head breaks through joint capsule below glenoid cavity
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/lxdd855.png =150x)
- glenohumeral painful arc syndrome
    - calcium deposits in **subacromial bursa** leads to **bursitis** (inflammation)
    - pain when arm is abducted betwen 60*-120*
