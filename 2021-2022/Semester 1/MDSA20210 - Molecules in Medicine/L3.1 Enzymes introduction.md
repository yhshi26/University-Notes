### **Enzymes = protein catalysts**

- catalysis: whereby a chemical reaction is facilitated (sped up/made easier) by a catalyst
- enzymes may require a co-factor (e.g. metal or co-enzyme)
    - enzyme holds onto co-factor which actually contributes more to catalysis of the substrate (what the enzyme is working on)

#### **Co-enzymes:**

- 4 especially important co-enzymes: NAD, NADP, FAD, FMN
    - function: take H or give H to carry out chemical reactions

#### **Catalytic cycle:**

- substrate binds to enzyme, forming non-covalent enzyme-substrate complex
- reaction takes place while enzyme and substrate are bound
- enzyme is regenerated at the end of the catalytic cycle

#### **Enzyme classification:**

- substrate(s) → product(s)
- name = substrate + reaction type + "ase"
    - e.g. glucose oxidase
- 6 main classes

#### **Enzymes:**
- increase rate (or velocity)
    - lower activation energy (ΔG)
- increase reverse reaction
    - S → P and P → S
    - equilibrium: K~eq~ = [P]/[S]
        - not changed by enzyme
        - determined only by ΔG~reaction~
- enzymes (summary)
    - do change rate
    - do not change equilibrium

#### **Active sites:**

- region of an enzyme where substrate molecules bind and undergo a chemical reaction
- the active site consists of amino acid residues that form temporary bonds with the substrate and residues that catalyse a reaction of that substrate
**How enzymes work:**
    1. lock and key model
    2. induced-fit model

#### **Relationship between energy change and equilibrium:**
- small change in change in gibbs free energy = big change in K~eq~

#### **4 examples of mechanisms:**

1. entropy effect; keep reactants in close proximity
2. stabilisation of transition state (most common)
3. acid-base catalysis
4. covalent catalysis
- also metal ion catalysis e.g. Fe^2+^ ←→ Fe^3+^ + e
    - use e- to stabilize positive charged intermediate or use Fe^3+^ to remove e-

#### **Enzyme kinetics:**

Relationship between rate and [S]?

- S → P (but also S ← P once [P] increases)

Measure initial velocity at different [S]

#### **V vs [S]:**
![](https://i.imgur.com/meOWYrw.png =350x)

**2 important “parameters”:**

- V~max~ = “maximum reaction rate”
- K~m~ = [S] that gives half V~max~

#### **Michaelis Menten eq.:**

- rectangular hyperbola: 
  X = A*Y/(B+Y)
- 𝑉 = 𝑉~𝑚𝑎𝑥~*𝑆/𝐾~𝑚~+[𝑆]

#### **Use V~max~ and esp K~m~ to:**

- measure effects of inhibitors
- compare enzymes
- understand how particular enzymes work

**Example: K~m~ and ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase)**

- Liver ADH has lower K~m~ for ethanol than methanol
- 3 different ADH in humans
    - 1 low K~m~
    - missing in some individuals

#### **Estimating V~max~ and K~m~:**

- measure V at different [S]

#### **Lineweaver-Burk plot:**

𝑉 = 𝑉~𝑚𝑎𝑥~*𝑆/𝐾~𝑚~+[𝑆]
1/V = 1/V~max~ + K~m~/V~max~ * 1/[S]

- straight line
- y = mx+c
