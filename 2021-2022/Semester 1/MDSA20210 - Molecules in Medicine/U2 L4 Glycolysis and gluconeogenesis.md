#### Glucose
- the most abundant monosaccharide in nature
- sole component of all **storage** carbohydrates
- energy source for **all** cells
    - change in free energy from the oxidation of glucose to CO~2~ and H~2~O = -686 kcal/mol
- blood glucose levels **must** be maintained between 4mM-10mM

## Food to ATP: 3 stages of catabolism

## Glycolysis: lysis (splitting) of glucose
- universal energy-yielding pathway
- **only** pathway outside the mitochondria that directly generates ATP
- **sole source** of ATP in cells without mitochondria
    - red blood cells
    - cells of lens of eye
- **does not requires O~2~**

## Glycolysis: steps
- 6C glucose 'lysed' to 2x3C pyruvate
    - 10 enzyme catalysed reactions
    - priming stage: 2 ATP invested
    - energy generating stage: 4 ATP produced
    - 2 NADH produced

### Step 1: glucose to glucose-6-P
- 'locks' glucose into cell
- glucose-6-P is used by the cell for all pathways that require glucose
![](https://i.imgur.com/qS9jbtF.png =450x)
- Km of **hexokinases** <1mM
- feedback inhibition of **hexokinase** by glucose-6-P ensures that glucose is used by cells on an 'as need' basis
![](https://i.imgur.com/nmpF4Hh.png =250x)
- exception = liver: plays major role in regulating blood glucose levels
- Km of **glucokinase** ~10mM ensures that concentration of free glucose in liver can rise above that of fasting levels of glucose in blood, enabling glucose release from liver
- **glucokinase** is not inhibited by glucose-6-P; enables liver to remove glucose from the portal blood when levels rise after a meal

### Priming stage ("committing step")
- step 3 = production of fructose-1,6,-biphosphate
- committing step of glycolysis
- catalysed by **phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1)**
- the major regulatory enzyme of the pathway
![](https://i.imgur.com/UOiie0Q.png =275x)

### Splitting stage
![](https://i.imgur.com/GD6RDrF.png =400x)

### Energy producing stage
- 2 molecules of GAP metabolised to pyruvate
- 1st and 2nd reactions generate NADH and ATP respectively
- final reaction
    - generates 2nd ATP and pyruvate
    - catalysed by **pyruvate kinase**
        - important regulatory enzyme
        - is **activated** by fructose 1,6-biphosphate 
            - feedforward regulation: once the committed step is taken, the pathway speeds up
            - feedback inhibition by ATP

### What happens to pyruvate and NADH?
- anaerobic conditions take place:
    - in cells without mitochondria
    - or when oxygen supply is insufficient in cells with mitochondria
- aerobic conditions take place:
    - in cells with mitochondira and sufficient oxygen supply
    - normal situation in most cells
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/ruyV0em.png =250x)

#### Anaerobic conditions
![](https://i.imgur.com/dCRQMlZ.png =250x)
- anaerobic glycolysis:
    - glucose + 2 ADP + 2 Pi â†’ 2 lactate + **2 ATP** + 2H^+^
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/XNUK6uo.png =350x)
- lactate production:
    - normal situations
        - red blood cells and cells of the lens of the eye (no mitochondria)
        - skeletal muscle during periods of strenuous activity (oxygen supply insufficient to produce ATP required via TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation)
    - disease situations
        - ischemia: blood supply to tissue blocked e.g. stroke
        - hypoxia: insufficient oxygen supply e.g. lung disease
        - anemia: insufficient Hb to deliver oxygen to tissues
        - non-vasculated tumours: no blood supply to deliver oxygen
        - "warburg effect" in malignant cells: high rate of glycolysis even when have sufficient oxygen supply
    - lactate produced in tissues is transported via blood to liver where it is re-converted to pyruvate (cori cycle)

##### Pyruvate to acetyl coA
- pyruvate dehydrogenase requires 4 co-enzymes
    - NAD/H (vitamine B~3~)
    - coenzyme A (vitamin B~5~)
    - thiamin pyrophosphate (vitamin B~1~)
    - lipoic acid
![](https://i.imgur.com/Nl7Iz3r.png =350x)
- pyruvate crosses the inner mitochondrial membrane via a specific tranport protein: exchanges for OH^-^
- converted to acetyl coA by enzyme complex, pyruvate dehydrogenase:
    - 3 enzyme activities
    - highly regulated
    - diagram: regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex

##### NADH transport to mitochondria
- no carrier for NADH across inner mitochondrial **membrane**
- transfers electrons to:
    - malate; results in production of 2.5 ATP
    - or glycerophosphate; results in 1.5 ATP

### ATP yield from breakdown of glucose

#### Aerobic:
| process | products | ATP |
| ------- | -------- | --- |
| glycolysis | 2 ATP | 2 ATP | 
| | 2 NADH in cytosol | 3-5 ATP | 
| pyruvate to acetyl-coA x 2 | 2 NADH in mitochondria | 5 ATP | 
| TCA cycle x 2 | 2 GTP | 2 ATP | 
| | 6 NADH | 15 ATP | 
| | 2 FADH~2~ | 3 ATP | 
| total ATP yield | | 30-32 ATP | 

#### Anaerobic:
- 2 ATP

### Regulation and PFK-1
- rapid adjustment in response to needs of cell
![](https://i.imgur.com/jmeVdf5.png =450x)

## Gluconeogenesis (making new glucose)
- takes place in liver when:
    - blood glucose levels decrease
    - liver glycogen stores are depleted
- glucose is synthesised 'de novo' from:
    - breakdown products of amino acids
    - **glycerol** from breakdown of triglycerides
    - **lactate** from anaerobic breakdown of glucose in red blood cells, exercising muscle... (cori cycle)
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/0qsUEUX.png =200x)

### Gluconeogenesis and glycolysis
- gluconeogenesis uses 7 of the 10 enzyme-catalysed reactions of glycolysis
- specific 'by-pass' reactions at the 3 regulatory steps of glycolysis
- consumes 6 ATP
![](https://i.imgur.com/dqAgIih.png =250x)
- regulatory enzymes in glyconeogenesis:
    - pyruvate carboxylase
        - carboxylases add a C group from CO~2~ to the enzyme substrate, using ATP
    - **fructose 1,6 biphosphatase**
    - glucose-6-phosphatase

### Gluconeogenesis: 1st by-pass steps
- 2 reactions convert pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate: both use ATP/GTP
    - **pyruvate carboxylase:**
        - requires biotin (a B vitamin) as cofactor
        - activated by acetyl coA
        - inhibited by ADP
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/TneZqE4.png =250x)
    - **PEPCK:**
        - 2 isoforms, mitochondrial and cytosolic
        - PEP transported from mitochondria to cytosol
        - oxyaloacetate "movement" to cytosol via conversion to malate or aspartate
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/Mi11CTm.png =250x)

### Gluconeogensis: 2nd by-pass step
- rate-limiting step in glyconeogenesis
- reverse reaction to that catalysed by PFK-1, the rate-limiting step in glycolysis
- **fructose 1,6 biphosphatase**
    - **activated** by ATP and citrate
    - **inhibited** by AMP
    - opposite to how these metabolites affect PFK-1

![](https://i.imgur.com/AsLpF6B.png =300x)

### Gluconeogenesis: final step (glucose-6-p to glucose)
- enzyme embedded in the ER membrane enables glucose secretion out of cell
- glucose 6-phosphatase only present in liver and kideny

## Recap
- glycolysis:
    - lysis of glucose to pyruvate
    - produces 2 ATP and 2 NADH
    - key regulatory enzyme = phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK-1)
    - sole ATP producing pathway in cells without mitochondria
    - fate of pyruvate:
        - aerobic: acetyl-coA: TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation
        - anaerobic: reduced to lactate
    - net energy yield from glucose:
        - aerobic: 30 ATP
        - anaerobic: 2 ATP
- gluconeogenesis:
    - 'de novo' production of glucose in the liver from lactate, glycerol and amino acid breakdown products
    - bypass reactions: pyruvate to PEP; fructose 1,6 biphosphatate to fructose-6-P; glucose-6-P to glucose
    - key regulatory enzyme = fructose 1,6 biphosphatase
- fructose 2,6 biphosphate = metabolic via which glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are regulated by hormones
