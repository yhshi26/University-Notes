## Translation
- protein synthesis
- RNA → amino acid
- mRNA is translated by ribosomes
    - rRNA and proteins
    - rRNA catalyzes peptide bond formation
- tRNA transfers amino acids to be added
- miRNA regulates translation

### Genetic coding
#### How do 4 bases code for 20 amino acids?
- the 4 bases can be arranged in codon triplets 
    - there are 4^3^ (64) possible codons
    - multiple codons code for the same amino acids, resulting with 20 possible amino acids (this is referred to as [**codon degeneracy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codon_degeneracy))
    - genetic code exhibits [**colinearity**](http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/what-is-a-gene-colinearity-and-transcription-430) (nucleotide sequences in genes dictate amino acid sequences in proteins)

#### Cracking genetic code  (1960s)
- scientists produced synthetic mRNA
- added synthetic mRNA and radioactively marked amino acids to E. coli and observed produced polypeptides

#### Important codons to know:
AUG → start (also codes for Met)
UAA, UAG, UGA → stop (termination of nonsense codons)

## Translation overview

- the reading frame of messenger RNA (mRNA) and the importance of the start and stop codons
    - A: the ribosome identifies the start codon (AUG), then reads successive base triplets as codons
    - B: the overall structure of mRNA, with 5'-untranslated sequence upstream the start codon, and 3'-untranslated sequence downstream the stop codon
        - the 5'-untranslated region is required for the initial binding of the mRNA to the ribosom eduring the initiation of translation

### Mutations
> chapter 10, pg. 154
- **point mutations** 
    #### silent mutations: degenerate positions
    - normally no phenotypic change
    - can alter splicing
        - disease
        - cancer
    - only detected by DNA sequencing
    - example: SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms)
    #### missense mutations: changed amino acid
    - example: haemoglobinpathies
    - most familiar is sickle-cell anemia
        - GAA → GUA or
        - GAG → GUG at codon 6
    - hundreds of other globin mutations known
    #### nonsense mutation: create stop codon
    - example: thalassemia 
        - imbalance in globin production or absence of one globin
            - e.g. AAG → UAG at codon 17 of beta globin (beta thalasssemia)
    #### read through mutation: change stop codon to non-stop
- **frameshift mutations**
    #### insertion or deletion (1,2,4,5,7 etc. bases)
    - example: alpha thalassemia
        > pg. 165-166
        - 4 copies of alpha globin gene
            - 2 on each chromosome 16
            - deletion of 1-4 copies causes disease
            - includes read through mutation of stop codon

## Translation
### Ribosomes
- bind to mRNA
- recognize start of coding sequence
- move along coding sequnce
    - read RNA, codon by codon
        - 5' to 3'
    - add amino acids to protein chain
        - from N terminus to C terminus
    - need an "adaptor" molecule (transfer RNA - tRNA)
        #### Transfer RNA (tRNA)
        - approx. 50 per organism
        - 1+ for each amino acid
        - 20 tRNA synthetases
            - attach 1 amino acid to 1 tRNA
        - each tRNA recognizes 1 or 2 codons
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/Y73yMHv.png =300x)
    #### Structure
    - 2 subunits: "large" and "small"
    - small subunit (humans)
        - 34 proteins
        - 1 RNA
            - SSU or 18S rRNA
    - large subunit (humans)
        - 50 proteins
        - 3 RNA
            - LSU or 28S rRNA
            - 5.8S and 5S
### Ribosome positioning
- ribosome needs to be correctly positioned
- bacteria 
    - RBS: ribosome binding site
        - Shine-Dalgarno seq.
- humans
    - first AUG in mRNA
        - sometimes

## Translation overview
- start with Met (start codon → AUG) as first amino acid
- add amino acids in order specified by codons
    - in frame
- stop at stop codon
    - UAA, UAG, or UGA 
- post-translational modifications
