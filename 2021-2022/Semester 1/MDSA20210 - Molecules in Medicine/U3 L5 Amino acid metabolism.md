### Protein metabolism
- average 70kg person contains approx. 20% protein (~14kg)
- approx. 2% (~300g) turned over every day (i.e. broken down and resynthesised)
- approx. 75% of amino acids for new protein synthesis recycled from protein breakdown
- remaining 25% and amino acids from dietary intake used for protein synthesis, synthesis of amino acid derivatives and other nitrogen containing compounds
- amino acid surplus to these needs are broken down (cannot be stored)
- C skeleton recycled or oxidised for energy, amino group excreted as urea
    - amino acid oxidation accounts for approx. 10-15% of daily energy production
    - can be increased in some disease states in starvation

### Nitrogen balance
- refers to the state where amount of nitrogen consumed is matched by the amount excreted
- negative nitrogen balance (nitrogen excretion >> nitrogen consumption)
    - protein breakdown > protein synthesis (loss of lean body mass: muscle)
    - starvation
    - cachexia (cancer, congestive heart failure, COPD et al)
    - dietary deficiency of essential amino acids
- positive nitrogen balance (nitrogen consumption >> nitrogen excretion)
    - protein synthesis > protein breakdown (accretion of lean body mass: muscle)
    - growing children
    - pregnancy

## Amino acid synthesis
### Amino acids are synthesised from common metabolic intermediates
![](https://i.imgur.com/QMawoxk.png =450x)

### Essential and non-essential amino acids
- humans can synthesise 10/11 of the 20 standard amino acids (non-essential amino acids)
- remaining amino acids must be supplied in the diet (essential amino acids)
- some non-essential amino acids can become essential in certain physiological and pathological states

## Amino acid degradation
### Amino acid catabolism
- amino acids in excess of protein synthesis requirements cannot be stored
    - broken down and recycled
- separate **amino group** from carbon skeleton (deamination)
    - used in biosynthesis of N containing compounds
    - converted to urea and excreted
- **carbon skeleton** may be recycled or oxidised to produce energy

### Overview of amino acid catabolism
![](https://i.imgur.com/tSGXwXh.png =300x)

#### Removal of nitrogen from amino acids is a 2 step process
- step 1: transamination with alpha-ketoglutew alpha-keto acid
- step 2: glutamate is deaminated through oxidative process involving NAD^+^
![](https://i.imgur.com/gznpshD.png =450x)

#### Amino acids and alpha keto acids
- removal of amino group converst amino acid to alpha keto acid (and vice versa)
- alpha keto acid is equivalent to the carbon skeleton of the amino acid
![](https://i.imgur.com/2L2Xe1A.png =350x)
- common amino acid/alpha keto acid pairs
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/RsC0qcM.png =400x)

#### Transamination
- transaminase (aminotransferase) enzymes catalyse transfer of an alpha amino group from an amino acid to an alpha keto acid
- amino donor becomes an alpha keto acid (green) while the amino receptor (alpha keto acid) becomes an amino acid (pink)
![](https://i.imgur.com/YuQJtws.png =350x)
- all aminotransferases utilise **PLP (pyridoxal phosphate, B group vitamin) as a cofactor**
- most common amino acid acceptors are alpha ketoglutarate (forming glutamate) and oxaloacetate (forming aspartate)

##### 2 important transamination reactions
- most transaminases have a preference for alpha ketogluarate or oxaloacetate as amino group acceptor
    - amino groups of many different amino acids end up in glutamate/aspartate
    - alanine, glutamate and aspartate are 3 of the 4 most abundant amino acids and are central to mino acid metabolism
- important interface between amino acid metabolism and **energy metabolism**
    - **oxaloacetate** and **alpha ketoglutarate** are intermediates in the TCA cycle whilst **oxaloaceteate** and **pyruvate** are gluconeogenic precursors
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/akM5llR.png =350x)

#### Oxidative deamination of glutamate yields NH~4~^+^
- oxidative deamination of glutamate catalysed by **glutamate dehydrogenase**
- **reaction fully reversible**
    - **important in both amino acid synthesis and breakdown**
- liver, muscle, kidney
    - **mitochondrial matrix**
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/5xAPoGI.png =200x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/IvjQqJ9.png =200x)
- **NH~4~^+^ toxic: cannot be allowed to accumulate, must be excreted**

### Glucogenic and ketogenic amino acids
- glucogenic amino acids are those whose C skeletons are converted to intermediates which can lead to net glucose synthesis (gluconeogenesis)
- ketogenic amino acids are those whose C skeletons are converted to intermediates which cannot lead to glucose tynthesis but can lead to synthesis of fatty acids and ketone bodies
- several amino acids are both glucogenic and ketogenic
![](https://i.imgur.com/bNpkYL9.png =350x)

### Fate of ammonium ion: recycled or excreted as urea
- some NH~4~^+^ utilised in biosynthesis of nitrogen containing compounds
    - amino acids, purines, etc.
- NH~4~^+^ toxic:
    - aquatic animals excrete NH~4~^+^ directly
    - birds and reptiles excrete NH~4~^+^ in form of uric acid
    - terrestrial vertebrates convert NH~4~^+^ to urea
- conversion of NH~4~^+^ occurs in liver
    - urea cycle

#### Ammonia is transported to liver as glutamate and glutamine
- extrahepatic tissues can break amino acids down but cannot process the amino groups for excretion: **urea cycle occurs in liver**
- excess ammonia in tissues is converted to glutamate and glutamine but the enzymes **glutamate dehydrogenase (reductive amination)** and **glutamine synthetase**
![](https://i.imgur.com/cttCMod.png =200x)
- glutamate and glutamine taken up by liver and NH~4~^+^ is generated in mitochondria by enzymes glutamate dehydrogenase (oxidative deamination) and **glutaminase**
![](https://i.imgur.com/atbHTeN.png =200x)

### Glucose alanine cycle
- converts pyruvate to alanine (transamination) and exports to liver
- in liver, C skeleton of alanine may be used in lguconeogenesis (make glucose), amino group enters urea cycle
![](https://i.imgur.com/GhFnIoD.png =350x)

## Overview of urea cycle
- **occurs in liver**
    - reactions divided between cytosol and mitochondria
- amino group enter cycle as:
    - citrulline (via carbomoyl phosphate)
    - aspartate
- 2 amino groups released as urea
    - excreted by kidney
- cycle is completed when ornithine condenses with carbamoyl phosphate
- cycle is regulated by activity of rate limiting enzyme **carbamoyl phosphate synthetase**
![](https://i.imgur.com/Yq4Fpfc.png =300x)

### Mitochondrial phase of urea cycle
- first nitrogen acquiring reaction is synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate
- formation of citrulling from ornithing and carbamoyl phosphate (first reaction of cycle)
![](https://i.imgur.com/PzkdHRD.png =450x)

### Cytosolic phase of urea cycle
![](https://i.imgur.com/druSKu5.png =450x)

### Regulation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS)
- CPS is allostreically activated by N-acetylglutamate: enzyme is inactive in absence of NAG
- this derivative of glutamate is synthesiszed from acetyl-coA and glutamate when cellular glutamate levels are high
    - allosterically activated by arginine
- this signals high levels of free amino acids and the ned to upregulate the urea cycle
![](https://i.imgur.com/b9a6G4I.png =250x)

### Clinical correlation: urea cycle disorders
- disorders of urea cycle potentially fatal because there is no alternative pathway for urea synthesis
- hyperammonemia
    - acid/base disturbances
    - neurotoxic
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/aQOG87d.png =450x)

#### Treatment of urea cycle disorders
- restrict dietary protein intake
- supplement diet with arginine
- enrich diet with alpha keto acids
- supplement diet with compounds that provide alternative means of ntirogen excretion
    - benzoate or phenylbutyrate
    - liver transplant

## Metabolic disorders of amino acid catabolism
![](https://i.imgur.com/Tbo1CWM.png =450x)

### Phenylketonuria
- tyrosine synthesised by phenylalanine hydroxylase
    - requires tetrahydrobiopterin (BH~4~) as cofactors
- phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency causes **phenylketonuria (PKU)**
    - **biochemical** screening in newborn babies
    - "musty odor" in baby's sweat and urine
    - left untreated, can cause progressive neurological degeneration, brain damage, and seizures
    - lifelong dietary phenylalanine restriction and tyrosine supplementation
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/2KpwTRi.png =200x)

### Disorders of phenylalanine and tyrosine breakdown
![](https://i.imgur.com/b7y8YmY.png =450x)

### Maple syrup urine disease
- metabolism of branched chain amino acids **(valine/isoleucine/leucine)** initiated in muscle
- specific BCAA aminotranferase in **muscle only**
- degradation of alpha keto acid intermediate catalysed by **branched chain alpha keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH)**
- genetic defieicny of BCKDH causes **maple syrup urine disease** (named after colour of urine)
- dietary restriction of BCAA to minimum level required for normal growth
![](https://i.imgur.com/qtugmBH.png =300x)

## Regulation of amino acid metabolism
- 2 key control points
    - glutamate dehydrogenase (mitchondrial matrix)
    - glatamine synthetase
- gateways for incoporation of N into many other amino acids and other nitrogenous compounds
- both subject to allosteric regulation which in the case of GS can be further modified by covalent modification
- since GDH reaction reversible, this is an important control point for amino acid breakdown and synthesis

### Allosteric regulation of glutamate dehydrogenase
- GDH catalyses reversible reaction
    - reductive amination of alpha ketoglutarate (incorporation of amino group from NH~4~)
    - oxidative deamination of glutamate (removal of amino group as NH~4~)
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/F55Lula.png =350x)
- high levels of ATP/GTP (energy abundance) favours glutamate production
    - anabolic/amino acid and protein synthesis
- lowe levels of ADP and/or GTP (low energy) favours alpha ketoglutarate production
    - oxidised via TCA cycle to generate ATP

### Allosteric regulation of glutamine synthetase
- GS is a key enzyme in controlling flow of nitrogen into biological molecules
    - glutamine serves as amino group donor for synthesis many amino acids, nucleotides, amino sugars, etc.
- enzyme is subject to **cumulative** feedback **inhibition** by at least 8 different regulators
- cell's 'nitrogen sensor'
- when all present at high levels enzyme activity fully repressed
- allosteric regulation modified by covalent modification of GS
![](https://i.imgur.com/z1mGXtW.png =300x)

## Recap
- amino acids are broken down into the **alpha amino group** and the **carbon skeleton**
    - the alpha amino group is removed by tarnsamination to form glutamate in a reaction catalysed by a family of **PLP dependent aminotransferases**
    - glutamate undergoes oxidative deamination by **glutamate dehydrogenase** to yield ammonium ion (NH~4~^+^)
- excess NH~4~^+^ is converted to urea via the **urea cycle** for excretion
    - the initial reactions of the urea cycle take place in the mitochondria, the rest occur in the cytosol
    - urea cycle occurs only in liver so NH~4~^+^ is transported from tissues as alanine or glutamine
- **carbon skeletons** of deaminated amino acids converted into major **metabolic intermediates**
    - amino acids may be classified as **ketogenic** or **glucogenic** depending on their fate
- degradation of **branched chain amino acids** occurs primarily in **muscle**
- some serious metabolic disorders result from deficiency of enzymes involved in degradation of aromatic and branched chain amino acids **(phenylketouria and maple syrup urine disease)**
