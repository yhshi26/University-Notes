**Central dogma of biology:**
- transcription: DNA → RNA (RNA can → DNA using reverse transcriptase)
- translation: RNA → protein (protein cannot → RNA)

## Transcription:
- in prokaryotes and eukaryotes:

- purpose: expressing DNA
- copies a piece of DNA into RNA (this is described as transcription where RNA is transcribed)

### Purpose
- allows DNA "expression"
    - transcription is copying DNA → RNA
    - this is described as DNA being "transcribed"
    
### Process
- chromatin is unfolded such that RNA polymerases can access DNA template
- ribonucleoside triphosphates are used by RNA polymerases which catalyze RNA synthesis
    - RNA polymerase reads DNA 3' → 5'
        - coding strand = strand we want a copy of
        - template strand = strand complementary to coding strand which is read by RNA polymerase
        - transcript = RNA copy of coding strand, produced by RNA polymerase finding complementary nucleotides to those of the template strand
    - produces RNA copy of one strand, or one gene
        - forms RNA 5' → 3'
    - does not require a primer
        - RNA polymerase finds and opens DNA at promoter, forming transcription bubble
        - DNA topoisomerases prevent DNA from knotting

#### Explicit steps
- **initiation:** at promoters
    - controlled by transcription fators
    - gene expression
- **elongation:** addition of nucleotides to synthesize RNA transcript
- **termination:** DNA rewinds, RNA synthesis is complete
- extra steps of processing of the transcript (in eukaryotes)
    - introns are removed
    - stuff is added to ends
    - bases are modified
    - final product after processing: mature mRNA

## Gene structure

### Bacterial
- simple promoter near start of transcript
- gene transcribed as one piece of mRNA
- transcription terminates
    - terminator signal
- ready to translate
    - coding region
    - untranslated regions (UTRs)

### Eukaryotic
- complicated promoter near start of transcript
    - e.g. humans:
        - 2000 transcription factors
        - spread over 10s of kb
        - several kb from coding region
- pieces of mRNA removed before translation
    - introns (discovered by Richard Roberts, Phillip Sharp)

#### Post-transcriptional processing of mRNA
- introns are spliced (removed)
- 5' cap is added
- 3' end is cleaved at polyA site
- 3' polyA tail is added

##### Alternative transcripts
- alternative polyA sites
- alternative splicing
    - alternative introns/exons
- alternative promoters
