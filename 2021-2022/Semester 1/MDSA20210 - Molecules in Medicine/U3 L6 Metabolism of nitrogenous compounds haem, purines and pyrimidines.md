## Purines and pyrimidines
- hterocyclic organic compounds containing **nitrogen**
- purines 9 member ring structure (4N + 5C)
![](https://i.imgur.com/kLPhLSm.png =100x)
- pyrimidines 6 member ring structure (2N + 4C)
![](https://i.imgur.com/Jo4h6O1.png =125x)
- synthesised and degraded by separate and distinct pathways
- components of:
    - bases of DNA and RNA
    - nucleotides
    - many others...

### Nucleotides and nucleosides
- nucleoside
    - purine or pyrimidine + ribose (e.g. adenosine)
- nucleotide
    - purine or pyrimidine + ribose + 1 or more phosphates
- deoxynucleotide
    - purine or pyrimidine + **deoxy**ribose + 1 or more phosphates

## Overview of purine metabolism 
- de novo synthesis pathway
    - N atoms from amino acids and C atoms from CO~2~ and formate (HCOO^-^)
    - 7ATP per AMP/GMP formed: **DNA replication is energetically expensive**
- salvage pathway
    - nucleotides are degraded and free purines recycled back into nucleotides
- degradation 
    - AMP and GMP converted to uric acid and excreted

### De novo purine synthesis
- **points to note:**
    - purines are synthesised as nucleotides (not free purines)
    - requirement for tetrahydrofolate (C donor), glutamine and aspartates (N donors), PPP (ribose 5 phosphate)
    - IMP is a branch point
    - 6 ATP consumed
    - product = deoxyribonucleotides

#### Stage 1: ribose 5 phosphate to IMP
- **points to note:**
    - synthesis of PRPP (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate) is rate limiting step in puring synhtesis: also an important intermediate in pyrimidine synthesis
    - **requirement for tetrahydrofolate (C donor), glutamine (N donor)**
    - **6 ATP consumed**

##### Tetrahydrofolate
- B vitamin derivative (folic acid)
- functions as carrier/donor of 1C units

##### The folate cycle
- TH4 cycles between a number of forms: its main function is as a donor of 1C units in the de novo synthesis of purines, thymidylate (pyrimidine) and certain amino acids (glycine, methionine)
- in purine synthesis, an enzyme called dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is required to (re)generate TH4: which is a target of some anticancer drugs

#### Stage 2: IMP to AMP and GMP
- **points to note:**
    - IMP is a branch point in puring synthesis
    - ATP hydrolysis required for GMP synthesis and GTP hydrolysis for AMP synthesis
        - when GTP abundant, AMP production favoured and vice versa
        - **balances production of AMP and GMP**
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/vDfDeQx.png =350x)

#### Regulation of purine synthesis
- enzymes 1 and 2 from stage 1 are the main regulation points
    - PRPP synthetase (1) and glutamine PRPP amidotenasferase (2)
- classic feedback inhibition of first 2 enzymes in pathway by end products i.e. if levels of these nucleotides are high the pathway is inhibited vv
- **balanced production of AMP and GMP by virtue of cross regulation of each branch by the product of the other branch (previous slide)**
![](https://i.imgur.com/AWQ1Mzo.png =250x)

### Purine degradation
- **points to note:**
    - **AMP and GMP converted to xanthing (requires enzyme ADA for AMP)**
    - xanthine converted ot uric acid by **xanthine oxidase**
    - uric acid has poor solubility in H~2~O: it is excreted in urine as sodium urate
    - some mammals have the enzyme urate oxidase and convert urate to allantoin (more soluble than urate)
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/XwllVmO.png =350x)

#### Clinical correlation: ADA deficiency (ADA severe combined immunodeficiency, ADA SCID)
- rare autosomal recessive disorder
    - a purine metabolic disorder primarily affecting lymphocyte development and function
- pathophysiology:
    - accumulation of AMP/dAMP impairs purine/DNA synthesis, inhibits proliferation of T and B lymphocytes
    - underdeveloped thymus gland
    - immune system is severely compromised
- treatment:
    - donor bone marrow transplant
    - enzyme replacement therapy
    - gene therapy

#### Clinical correlation: gout and hyperuricemia
- overproduction and/or underexcretion of uric acid leading to formation of sodium urate crystals in joints and tissues
- repeated episodes leads to tissue destruction and sever arthritic malformations
- **xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol)** can be used to treat gout

### Purine salvage pathway
- nucleotides coverted to bases by successive removal of phosphate and ribose
![](https://i.imgur.com/URHNjed.png =400x)
- free purine bases can be degrades to ruic acid or **salvaged by conversion to their corresponding nucleotides by phosphiribosylation**
- defieincy of HGPRT causes lesch nyhan syndrom (hyperuricemia, cognitive, developmental, behavioural abnormalities)

#### Clinical correlation: lesch nyhan syndrome
- rare (<1 in 300,000) X lined disorder
- caused by deficiency of HGPRTase (enzyme of purine salvage pathway)
    - hyperuricemic state, increased oxidation/degradation of purines to uric acid, severe gout
- neurologic disability and behavioural problems
    - dystonia, delayed development, spasticity
    - cognitive impairment and aggressive and impulsive behaviour which includes predilection to self mutilation (lip, tongue and finger biting, head banging)
- life expectancy 10-20 years

## Overview of pyrimidine metabolism
- de novo synthesis
    - aspartate provides 3C and 1N atoms, other N and C atoms from glutamine and CO~2~
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/SyMXOYB.png =200x)
- salvage pathway
    - nucleotides are degraded and pyrimidines recycled
- degradation
    - UMP/CMP converted to beta-alanine (or beta-aminoisobutyrate for dTMP), NH~3~ and CO~2~

### Pyrimidine biosynthesis
- **points to note:**
    - carbamoyl phosphate syntehase II is a different isoform (cytoplasmic) of urea cycle enzyme
    - make heterocyclic ring, then add sugar
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/HUGL1v1.png =200x)

### De novo pyrimidine biosynthesis
- carbamoyl phosphate is the same compound as in the urea cycle but the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetse II is a different isoform of urea cycle enzyme
- 2 important sites of regulation:
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/GOqKDqv.png =125x)
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/ONZdpN0.png =450x)

### Degradation and salvage pathways
- pyrimidines undergo ring cleavage and the usual end products are beta-amino acids (alanine and aminoisobutyrate), NH~3~ and CO~2~
- pyrimidine bases resulting from nucleotide degradation can be recycled back into nucleotides by a **salvage pathway** similar to that of purines
    - **removal of phosphate, then removal of sugar**

## General scheme for synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides
![](https://i.imgur.com/NnfrsiQ.png =350x)

### Conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides
- deoxyribonucleotides formed rfom ribonucleotides by action of **ribonucleotide reductase** enzyme
- dTMP formed by methylation of dUMP (thymidylate synthetase)
![](https://i.imgur.com/O3wNUXi.png =450x)

#### Synthesis of dTMP from dUMP
- dTMP synthesised by methylation of dUMP
- catalysed by **thymidylate synthase** and requires methylene THF as cofactor (donates CH~3~ group)
![](https://i.imgur.com/YrT0JyG.png =125x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/5DMks1R.png =150x)

#### Clinical correlation: antifolate drugs
- antifolates:
    - class of antineoplastic drugs that act by inhibiting DHFR, blocking regeneration of DHF
    - some antifolates (e.g. pemetrexed) inhibit several THF requiring pathways (purine and pyrimidine synthesis)
- target actively dividing (e.g. neoplastic) cells
    - also have effects on frequently dividing non-neoplastic cells e.g. bone marrow, gastric mucosa
    - also used as antimalarial, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory drugs
- long term effectiveness comrpomised by development of antifolate resistance

## Haem synthesis
### Porphyrin structure and function
- porphyrins are **tetrapyrrole** structures
    - conjugated planar ring structure facilitates **electron transfer**
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/bbPU3mZ.png =50x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/qtpGtag.png =150x)
- contain a ivalent metal ion co-ordinated between the N atoms the 4 pyrrole rings
    - iron **(haem)**
    - magnesium **(chlorophyll)**
    - cobalt **(cobalamin vitamin B12)**
- prosthetic groups for wide range of proteins
    - oxygen transport
    - redox reactions (electron transfer)
        - cytocrhome P450
        - mitochondiral oxidative phosphorylation
        - chloroplast photosystem I and II

#### Clinical correlation: porphyrias
- disorders of porphyrin metabolism characterised by **overproduction** or **accumulation** of haem and/or its precursors
    - **inherited** (genetic disorders of porphyrin synthesis)
    - **acquired** (heavy metal poisoning)
- classificaiton and clinical manifestations:
    - hepatic (acute): mainly affect nervous system
        - severe abdominal pain
        - acute neuropathy
        - muscle weakness
        - seizures
        - psychosis (hallucinations, anxiety, paranoia)
    - cutaneous (erythropoietic): mainly affect skin
        - photosensitivity (skin blistering and necrosis)
        - hypertichosis
        - **no abdominal pain**
    
#### Acquired porphyrias
- lead poisoning
- lead toxicity can mimic symptoms of porphyrias
    - activity of **porphobilinogen synthase** is Zn^2+^ dependent
    - lead displaces Zn^2+^ from porphobilinogen synthase
    - enzyme activity reduced, accumulation of ALA
    - lead also inhibits ferrochelatase (accumulation of protoporphyrin IX)
- ALA may cause some neurological effects like lead poisoning

### Degradation of haem
- hemoglobin from senescent or hemolyzed red cells is broken down cells of reticuloendothelial system (macrophages) in spleen and liver
- heme is degraded into **biliverdin** by the enzyme heme ozygenase (HO)
- biliverdin (a hydrophilic compound) is reduced by biliverdin reductase into the hydrophobic compound **bilirubin**
- transported to liver as as complex with serum albumin and taken up by liver in carrier mediated process

#### Bilirubin metabolism
![](https://i.imgur.com/r2GohMj.png =450x)

## Summary
- cells synthesise a wide range of nitrogen containing compounds and amino acids, especially glutamine, act as N donors
- purines and pyrimidines can be synthesised de novo or by salvage pathways: these pathways are important therapeutic targets for many anti-cancer drugs
- disorders of purine and pyrimidine metabolism are associated with diseases ranging from gout to SCID
- heme is synthesised in the mitochondria and cytoplasm
- disorders of heme metabolism may be inherited (porphyrias) or acquired (heavy metal poisoning) and are associated with either neurovisceral or cutaneous manifestations
- heme is degraded to bilirubin and acts as a bile pigment
- jaundice is caused by accumulation of bilirubin which can cause neurological damage in children
