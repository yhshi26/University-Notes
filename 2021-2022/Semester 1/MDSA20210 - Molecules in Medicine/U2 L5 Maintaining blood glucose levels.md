#### Review: ATP from glucose 
- major energy source for all cells
- aerobic breakdown of glucose yields 30-32 ATP
- anaerobic breakdown of glucose to lactate yields 2 ATP

### Glucose: tissue requirements
- cells without mitochondria:
    - absolute dependence on glucose for energy needs
    - anaerobic glycolysis: 2 ATP
- cells of the nervous system: do have mitochondria
    - high energy need: ~20% of the body's oxygen and ~60% of the body's glucose consumed by brain
    - glucose is the sole energy source used by the brain in normal conditions
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/Fdl3e8b.png =250x)
- **tissues require a continual supply of glucose from the bloodstream**
- cells that have less strict requirements:
    - cardiac, skeletal and adipose cells
        - glucose
        - fatty acids

### Glucose in bloodstream
- ideally maintained between 4-10mM
- high blood glucose levels after a meal triggers insulin release from pancreas

### Glucose uptake by tissues
- via glucose transporters (GLUTs)
- transporters on brain, RBC, liver, kidney, etc. continually present at cell surface
- transporter on muscle and adipose tissue:
    - GLUT-4: insulin sensitive
    - take up glucose **when glucose levels in blood are high** to reduce blood glucose levels

## "Fed" state: high blood glucose
- insulin acts to:
    - stimualte glucose uptake by muscle and adipose tissue
    - increase glycolysis
    - increase glycogen synthesis (liver and skeletal muscle)
- in liver:
    - excess glucose used for:
        - glycogen synthesis
        - synthesis of fatty acids
            - via glycolysis
- in skeletal muscle:
    - excess glucose used for:
        - glycogen synthesis
- in cardiac muscle:
    - increased glucose used to:
        - supply ATP for cell's own needs
        - switches from using fatty acids
- in adipose tissue:
    - excess glucose used to:
        - synthesise triglycerides for storage
            - via glycolysis

### Regulation of glycolysis and PFK-1
- fructose 2,6 biphosphatase (F2,6BP) levels increase in response to insulin
- over-rides effects of ATP, citrate: increases glycolysis
- acetyl-coA produced used to synthesise fats for storage

### Glycogen synthesis
- three stages:
    - priming: energy input
    - elongation: addition of glucose to the non-reducing ends of alpha 1-4 chains
    - branching: formation of alpha 1-6 branch points
- enzymes embedded in the outer branches of the glycogen granule

#### Stage 1: priming
![](https://i.imgur.com/cozf8eC.png =350x)
- UDP-glucose = "activated" glucose used in biosynthetic reactions

#### Stage 2: elongation and branch formation
![](https://i.imgur.com/mfsMJ6p.png =350x)
- **glycogen synthase** = major regulatory enzyme in glycogen synthesis
    - stimulated by cellular levels of glucose-6-P

## Glucose in bloodstream
- effects of insulin stimulate a decrease in blood glucose
- blood glucose levels drop
- **glucagon** released from pancreas
- fasting state

## Fasting state: low blood glucose
- insulin levels drop
    - muscle and adipose tissue stop taking up glucose (GLU-4 no longer expressed on cell surface)
    - "spares" glucose for use of cells that require it most
- glucagon acts on **liver** to:
    - decrease glycolysis
    - **breakdown glycogen**
    - increase **gluconeogenesis** releasing glucose into the bloodstream
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/G9ctNgq.png =200x)

### Glycogen degradation
- **glycogen phosphorylase** = major regulatory enzyme in glycogen degradation
- glucose-1-P converted to glucose-6-P by phosphoglucomutase (PGM)
![](https://i.imgur.com/IMb8abO.png =350x)

#### Liver vs. muscle
- glycogen phosphorylase (allosteric control)
    - in muscle tissue inhibited by glucose-6-P and ATP; activated by AMP (glycogen in muscle used solely for muscle's own energy needs)
    - inhibited by glucose in liver tissue
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/kuzMmxU.png =350x)

#### Hormonal regulation: insulin and glucagon in the liver
- reciprocal regulation via phosphorylatioon and dephosphorylation of enzymes
    - insulin: stimulates dephosphorylation
    - glucagon: stimulates phosphorylation
- glycogen metabolism
    - high blood glucose: insulin activated glycogen synthesis and blocks glycogen breakdown
    - low blood glucose: glucagon blocks glycogen synthesis and activates glycogen breakdown
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/IJQyceG.png =200x)

#### Hormonal regulation: catecholamines in skeletal muscle
- adrenalin/noradrenalin (also called epinephrine/norepinephrine)
- act to stimulate phosphorylation of enzymes
- glycogen metabolism: block synthesis and enhance breakdown
- act to increase levels of fructose 2,6-biphosphate: **stimulate glycolysis**
![](https://i.imgur.com/SeaOug9.png =200x)

#### Genetic deficiencies
- **glycogen storage diseases:** deficiencies in enzymes involved in glycogen degradation
    - hepatic forms: fasting hypoglycemia, liver damage
    - myopathic forms: muscle weakness and wasting
- accumulation of glycogen in affected tissues
- von gierke disease: **glucose-6-phosphatase** deficiency 
    - inability to convert glucose-6-P to glucose in liver
- mcardle disease: deficiency of **glycogen phosphorylase** in muscle tissue

## Fasting state: low blood glucose
- liver glycogen stores: depleted after approximately 24 hours fasting
- subsequently rely on **gluconeogenesis** to maintain blood glucose levels
![](https://i.imgur.com/GyKFvvc.png =400x)

### Gluconeogenesis and glycolysis 
- gluconeogenesis uses 7 of the 10 enzyme-catalysed reactions of glycolysis
- specific 'by-pass' reactions at the 3 regulatory steps of glycolysis
- consumes 6 ATP
![](https://i.imgur.com/2iLMsS9.png =200x)

### Glucose-6-P to glucose
- final reaction in gluconeogesis **and** glycogen breakdown in liver
- enzyme embedded in the ER membrane: enables glucose secretion out of cell
- glucose 6-phosphatase mainly expressed in liver (and kidney)
![](https://i.imgur.com/LkUIjRh.png =350x)

### Von gierke disease
- **type I glycogen storage disease**
- deficiency in **glucose-6-phosphatase**
- glucose-6-P from glycogen breakdown **and** gluconeogenesis not converted to glucose
- no glucose released from liver to replenish blood and glucose levels
- profound fasting hypoglycemia
- patients kept alive by regular carbohydrate feeding, day and night
- nocturnal gastric infusions of glucose or uncooked corn starch

### Hormonal regulation in liver: glycolysis and gluconeogenesis
- **fructose 2,6 bisphosphate** = molecule via which **insulin** and **glucagon** influence glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver
- high cellular levels: glycolysis 'on'; gluconeogenesis 'off'
- cellular levels determined by the activity of a protein that has 2 enzyme activities (bifunctional)

### Fructose 2,6-biphosphate levels

## Recap
- constant supply of circulating glucose required for brain and red blood cell function
- when blood glucose levels high ('fed' state, after a meal):
    - insulin is released from the pancreas
    - glucose uptake by muscle and adipose tissue increased: insulin-sensitive uptake
    - breakdown of glucose via glycolysis is stimulated: used for fat synthesis in adipose tissue and liver
    - glycogen synthesis in liver and muscle increased
- when blood glucose levels decrease (fasting state):
    - glucagon is released from the pancras
    - in the liver, glucagon stimulates:
        - glycogen breakdown
        - gluconeogenesis, producing glucose that is released into the blood stream
- in exercising skeletal muscle, the catecholamines stimulate glycogen breakdown and glycolysis for rapid energy generation
- glycogen storage diseases: genetic defects in glycogen breakdown
