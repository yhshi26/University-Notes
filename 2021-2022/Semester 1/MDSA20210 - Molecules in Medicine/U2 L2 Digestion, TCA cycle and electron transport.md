## Food → ATP: 3 stages of catabolism
- stage 1: digestion
    - hydrolysis of complex molecules (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids) to their component building blocks (amino acids, monosaccharides, glycerol/fatty acids)
- stage 2: breakdown with some ATP generation
    - conversion of building blocks to acetyl CoA (or other simple intermediates)
- stage 3: oxidation and ATP generation
    - oxidation of acetyl CoA: oxidative phosphorylation
    - followed by citric acid cycle (ATP generation with CO~2~ byproduct)

## Stage 1: digestion
- mouth → esophagus → stomach → small intestine → large intestine
    - mouth: breaks up food and hydrates it (increasing SA for easier digestion), salivary amylase starts breakdown of starch
    - stomach: further breaks up food by persitalsis (increasing SA), pepsin starts breakdown of proteins
    - pancreas: amylase, proteolytic enzymes, lipases
    - liver: bile salts emulsify fats
    - small intestine: brush border enzymes (peptidases, saccharidases)

### Carbohydrate digestion
- starch is broken down by salivary and pancreatic amylases → oligosaccharides, maltotriose and maltose
- broken down starch components, sucrose and lactose are broken down by brush-border enzymes (maltase/isomaltase, sucrase and lactase) → glucose, galactose and fructose which can be absorbed

### Protein digestion
- acid denaturation and **pepsin** hydrolysis in the stomach: protein digested to polypeptides
- pancreas secretes proteolytic enzymes (proteases) into the duodenum
    - endopeptidases: **tripsin, chymotrypsin, elastase**
    - exopeptidases: **carboxypeptidases A and B**
- brush border peptidases
    - **aminopeptidases, dipeptidases, carboxypeptidases**
    - hydrolase oligopeptides to amino acids

#### Proteolytic protection
- to prevent tissue breakdown, digestive proteases are produced as inactive **zymogens**
- pepsin: generated from inactive pepsin**ogen** in the low pH of stomach
- trypsin and chimotrypsin: secreted from the pancreas as inactive trypsin**ogen** and chymotrypsin**ogen**
- activation initiated by enterokinase in small intestine

### Fat digestion
- fats are emulsified by bile salts
- lipases
    - secreted by pancreas to duodenum
    - degrade bile-emulsified fats, releasing fatty acids
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/nfcOdZr.png =200x)

#### Pancreatic problems
- pancreatitis
    - inflammation of pancreas
    - triggers activation of inactive zymogens, especially trypsinogen
    - active trypsin degrades pancreatic tissue
- pancreatic insufficiency: characteristic of cystic fibrosis, pancreatic ducts blocked
    - patient cannot digest food: failure to thrive
    - treatment = pancreatic suppliments i.e. pancreatic enzyme tablets

## Stage 2: breakdown
(to be covered in subsequent lectures)

## Stage 3: oxidation and ATP generation

#### ATP generation and mitochondria
- in oxygen-using **(aerobic)** cells, the vast majority of ATP is generated by the **mitochondria**
- ATP is generated in the mitochondria through 2 sequential processes
    - the **tricarboxylic acid cycle (citric acid/kreb's cycle)** which takes place in the **mitochondrial matrix**
    - and **oxidative phosphorylation** which takes place in the **inner mitochondrial membrane**
    - the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation are the major ATP-generating pathways in all aerobic cells
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/RdVZYrf.png =200x)

#### Co-enzyme A
- common metabolite of all major food molecules = acetyl group bound to co-enzyme A: acetyl-coA
![](https://i.imgur.com/JvGKZRH.png =350x)
- co-enzyme A
    - carrier of acyl groups
    - forms high-energy thioester bond
    - derived from patothenic acid (vitamin B~5~)

### TCA/citric acid/kreb's cycle
- 2-C from acetyl-coA
- products:
    - 2 low energy C~2~ produced
    - energy transferred to 1 GTP (ATP), 3 NADH and 1 FADH~2~ (NADH and FADH~2~ most important products which feed into oxidative phsphorylation to produce ATP)

### Oxidative phosphorylation
- 3 steps:
    1. electrons transferred to oxygen step-by-step through **electron transfer** (oxidative)
    2. energy from electron transport is used to generate a H^+^ gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane
    3. electrochemical energy from H^+^ gradient used to **synthesize ATP** (phosphorylation)
- this process = where cells use oxygen to generate ATP: **respiratory chain**

#### Electron transport

![](https://i.imgur.com/iwsjgN0.png =350x)

#### Generating H^+^ gradient
- 10 H^+^ transported per NADH
- 6 H^+^ transported per FADH~2~
- electrochemical gradient = difference in charge and concentration across the inner mitochondrial membrane
![](https://i.imgur.com/HOgUiFV.png =300x)

#### ATP synthesis
- ATP synthase = molecular motor
- important note: 4 H^+^ required to synthesise 1 ATP
![](https://i.imgur.com/uo5QVVA.png =300x) ![](https://i.imgur.com/CorSRVj.png =150x)

#### Oxidative phosphorylation
- NADH oxidation produces 2.5 ATP (3 in some texts)
- FADH~2~ oxidation produces 1.5 ATP (2 in some texts)

### Energy yield from TCA and oxidative phosphorylation

| for every 2C entering TCA cycle | ATP |
| ------------------------------- | --- |
| GTP | 1 | 
| 3 NADH | 7.5 | 
| 1 FADH~2~ | 1.5 | 
| total | 10 | 

### Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation
- uncouplers carry H^+^ across the inner mitochondrial membrane
    - dissipate the H^+^ gradient
    - electron transport accelerates: attempting to generate H^+^ gradient
    - ATP not produced
- energy released as heat
- types of uncoupling:
    - physiological uncoupling:
        - in brown fat of infants and hibernating animals: 90% energy from electron transport used to generate heat
        - uncoupling protein = thermogenin (UCP1)
    - toxic uncoupling:
        - lipid soluble proton carriers
        - electron transport speeds up
        - hyperthermia; can result in death
        - 2,4-dinitrophenol sold on internet as diet pills

### Disruptors of oxidative phosphorylation
- cyanide prevents final transfer of electrons to oxygen
- stops electron transport chain
    - insufficient H^+^ gradient for ATP production
    - build-up of NADH and FADH~2~
- rapid loss of consciousness; death in minutes from fatal dose
- diagram: cyanide poisoning

### Regulation
- entire process (oxidation and ATP generation) regulated via regulation of TCA cycle

#### Regulation of TCA cycle
- regulated via enzymes that catalyse irreversible reactions
    - citrate synthase
    - isocitrate dehydrogenase
    - a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
![](https://i.imgur.com/YPNJrNa.png =250x)
- energy status of the cell
    - ATP inhibits
    - ADP stimulates
- NADH inhibits
- product inhibition
    - citrate
    - succinyl CoA
    - in skeletal muscle Ca^2+^ release (required for contraction) stimulates the cycle

#### TCA cycle = metabolic hub
- depending on a cell's needs, the TCA cycle distributes metabolites into energy production or synthesis of other biomolecules
- synthetic pathways are often tissue-specific

## Recap: food to ATP
- digetion: enzymatic hydrolysis of carbohydrates, proteins and fats from diet
- TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation = common pathways for ATP generation from food molecules in oxygen-consuming (aerobic) cells
    - the mitochondria = powerhouse of oxygen-consuming cells
- TCA cycle: axidises 2C acetyl groups to CO~2~, producing 1 ATP, 3 NADH and 1 FADH~2~
- oxidative phosphorylation: 3 steps
    1. electron transport
    2. formation of H^+^ gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane
    3. synthesis of ATP
