> learning objectives: delineate different types of epithelial tissues, recognize common arrangements of epithelial tissues and describe function, describe different types of secretion, recognize different types of glands

## Epithelium
- epi = upon, thelia = sheet
- covers external body surfaces (epidermis) and lines internal cavities
- epithelia are always attached to basement membrane
    - basement membrane = diffusion barrier
        - not visible in H and E (collagen type IV)

### Functions:
- **provide physical protection:** from abrasion, dehydration, and destruction by chemical or biological agents
- **control permeability:** any substance that enters or leaves the body needs to pass through an epithelium, highly regulated
- **transport material along surfaces:** e.g. transport of dust particles in the brochial tree
- **provide sensation:** most epithelia are extensively innervated with sensory nerves (e.g. touch receptors in the deepest epithelial layers of skin)
- **produce secretions:** in glands, most if not all epithelial cells produce secretions

### Characteristics:
- **cellularity:** composed of cells bound by cell junctions
- **polarity:** apical and basal surfaces
- **attachment:** via the basement membrane to underlying connective tissue
- **avascularity:** no blood vessels (but many nerves)
- **sheet** or layer arrangement
- **regeneration:** high capacity (stem cell division)

#### Cell junctions
- **tight junction** (TJ)
    - surrounds cell
    - waterproof seal
    - controls passage of molecules
- **adherens junction** (ZA)
    - links cytoskeletons
    - stabilizes nearby junctions
- **desmosome** (D)
    - anchores cell
    - great strength
- **gap junction** (G)
    - rapid communication
    - direct transfer of small molecules
- **hemidesmosome**
    - anchores to basal lamina

##### Summary
| Junction | Transmembrane link proteins | Cytoskeletal components | Functions | Medical significance|
| -------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| Tight junction (zonula occludens) | occludins, claudins, ZO proteins | actin filaments | seals adjacent cells, controls passage of molecules between them, separates apical and basolateral membrane domains | defects in occludins may compromise fetail blood-brain barrier, leading to severe neurological disorders |
| Adherent junction (zonula adherens) | e-cadherin, catenin complexes | actin filaments | provides points linking cytoskeletons of adjacent cells, strengthens and tightens nearby tight junctions | loss of e-cadherin in epithelial cell tumors (carcinomas) promotes tumor invasion and shift to malignancy | 
| Desmosome (macula adherens) | cadherin family proteins (desmogleins, desmocollin) | intermediate filaments (keratins) | provides points of strong intermediate filament coupling beyween adjacent cells, strengthening tissue | autoimmunity against desmoglein leads to dyshesive skin disorders characterized by reduced cohesion of epidermal cells | 
| hemidesmosome | integrins | intermediate filaments | anchors cytoskeleton to basal lamina | mutations in the integrin gene are linked to types of epidermolsis bullosa - a skin blistering disorder |
| gap junction (nexus) | connexin | none | allows direct transfer of small molecules and ions between cells | mutations in connexin genes are linked to types of deafness and peripheral neuropathy |

### Surface modifications
1. **Microvilli**
    - finger-like projection from apical membrane
    - short (1 μm)
    - increases SA for absorption or secretion
    - **a core of actin filaments maintains their structure**
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/w3bkN0I.png =150x)
2. **Stereocilia**
    - similar to microvilli but longer
    - longest surface modification
    - immotile 
    - facilitate absorption
    - rare, limited to epididymis, sensory cells of inner ear
3. **Cilia**
    - whip-like
    - long (7-10 μm)
    - contains a core of microtubules
    - highly motile, beat coherently
    - act to move materials/cells
        - e.g. mucus in airway, oocyte in oviduct

## Classification of epithelia
> epithelia are classified based on 2 criteria

1. arrangement of cell layers
    - **simple:** single layer
    - **stratified:** multiple layers
    - **psuedostratified:** looks stratified, but isn't (all cells attached to basal lamina, but not all reach surface)
2. shape of cells
    - **based on apical (outermost layer)**
    - **squamous:** flat
    - **cuboidal:** height = width
    - **columnar:** tall

![](https://i.imgur.com/bhhRfaT.png =275x)

### Simple squamous
- **single layer flattened cells** with
    - disc shaped nuclei
    - sparse cytoplasm
- function: important for diffusion (gases/fluids), asorption, secretion
- special names:
    - **mesothelium:** lines body cavities
    - **endothelium:** lines heart and blood vessels

### Simple cuboidal
- **single layer cube-like cells** with
    - large spherical nuclei
    - nuclei centrally located
- function: important for absorption, secretion
- location: kidney tubules, ducts, secretory portions of small glands

### Simple columnar
- **single layer tall cells** with
    - oval nuclei
    - nuclei often basally located
    - may contain microvilli or celia
        - globlet cells (no celia, often found in between)
- function: secrete mucus
- location: line most of digestive tract, gall bladder (non ciliated), small bronchi, uterine tubes, some regions of uterus (ciliated)

### Pseudostratified
- **single layer of cells** with
    - different cell heights
    - all cells on basal lamina
    - some cells don't reach surface
    - nuclei at different levels
- function: secretion and propulsion of mucus
- location: most of upper respiratory tract (ciliated), male sperm-carrying ducts (non-ciliated)

### Stratified squamous
- **several layers of cells** with
    - most apical layer squamous (flat)
- function: protection of underlying areas (against abrasion)
    - poorly suited for absorption
- location: forms external part of skin's epidermis (keratinised cells) and moist linings of the esophagus, mouth and vagina (non-keratinized cells)

### Stratified cuboidal
- **typically 2 layers thick**
    - top layer cuboidal
- quite rare in body
- location: some sweat and mammary glands

### Stratified columnar
- limited distribution in body
- location: small areas of pharynx, epiglottis, glandular ducts (e.g. salivary glands), transition areas between 2 other types of epithelia
    #### Transitional
    - features **intermediate** between stratified and cuboidal and stratified squamous
        - several cell layers
        - basal cells cuboidal
        - surface cells large, dome-shaped or flat
    - function: stretches to permit distension (e.g. urinary blader)
    - location: urinary bladder, ureters, part of urethra

## Glands
- **glands produce and secrete aqueous fluids** with substances that have specific functions
- **classified by site of product release:**
    - **endocrine** (endo = within, crine = secretion)
        - secrete hormones directly into blood systems
    - **exocrine** (exo = outside)
        - secrete substances into a body cavity which communicates with the exterior

### Endocrine glands
- no ducts
- produce and secrete products (hormones - amino acids, proteins, glycoproteins, steroids) into connective tissue from which they enter bloodstream to reach target cells

### Exocrine glands
- more numerous than endocrine
- secrete products onto body surfaces (skin) or into body cavities via **ducts**
    - e.g. mucus, sweat, saliva, digestive glands
    
### Exocrine secretion types
![](https://i.imgur.com/2ItEaOQ.png =225x)

#### Merocrine
1. delivery of product in membrane-bound vesicles to apical surface
2. vesciles fuse with plasma membrane and extrude contents **(exocytosis)**
- most common mechanism
- no loss of cell material
- e.g. pancreas, sweat, salivary glands

#### Apocrine
1. secretory vesicles accumulate in the apical portion of the cell
2. apical portion of cell sheds off
3. regrowth of cell

#### Holocrine 
1. cells disintegrate at apical surface
2. cells replenished by cell division in basal layer

### Gland histological structure

### Clinical consideration
- most epithelia are constantly renewed or repaired by mitosis
- many cancerous tumors arise from epithelial cells: loss of control of cell proliferation, abnormal high levels of mitosis
- **carcinoma:** malignant surface epithelial cancer
- **adenocarcinoma:** malignant glandular epithelial cancer
