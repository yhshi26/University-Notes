> learning objectives: list 5 functions of skeletal muscle, compare and contrast the gross and microscopic anatomy of a muscle, list and explain the steps involved in the contraction and relaxation of a skeletal muscle fiber, define a motor unit and explain how a motor unit is controlled by a single motor neuron, describe the arrangement of muscle fibers in skeletal/cardiac/smooth muscle

### Muscle - main functions
- produce skeletal movement
    - muscle contractions pull tendons → move bones
- maintain posture
    - balancing and stabilization of joints
- support soft tissues
    - abdominal wall, pelvic floor = layers of muscle support weight of organs and protect
- regulating entering and exiting material
    - voluntary control over swallowing, defecation, urination
- maintain body temperature
    - contraction → energy → heat
- affect blood flow

### 3 types of muscles:

Muscle = basic tissue type
- Characteristic function: contraction
- Origin: mesodermal

| Muscle types | Images | 
| ------------ | ------ | 
|1. Skeletal muscle contains bundles of very long, multinucleated cells with cross striations. Contraction is quick, forceful, and usually under voluntary control.|![](https://i.imgur.com/1YezE2i.png =100x)|
|2. Cardiac muscle also has cross-striations and is composed of elongated, often branched cells bound to one another at structures called intercalated discs that are unique to cardiac muscle. Contraction is involuntary, vigorous, and rhythmic.|![](https://i.imgur.com/NGCeXPL.png =100x)|
|3. Smooth muscle consists of collections of fusiform cells that lack striations. Contractions slow, involuntary.|![](https://i.imgur.com/tiuCaZU.png =100x)| 

### Muscle structure:

Muscle cell = **myofiber** (bundle of myofilaments → bundle of myofibrils → myofiber) = muscle fiber

- elongated, highly differentiated cell
- bundle of myofibers → bundle of muscle fibers → bundle of fascicles = muscle

Thin layers of connective tissue surround the fibers and bundles

#### Organ level:

**Epimysium** external sheath of dense
irregular connective tissue surrounds the entire muscle.
**Septa** of this tissue extends inward, carrying the larger nerves, blood vessels, and lymphatics of the muscle.
**Perimysium** thin connective tissue layer that immediately surrounds each fascicle.
Nerves, blood vessels, and lymphatics
penetrate the perimysium to supply each fascicle.

#### Bundle of cells level:
**Fascicle** bundle of muscle fibers (cells), makes up a functional unit in which the fibers work together
**Endomysium** very thin delicate layer of reticular fibers and scattered fibroblasts, surrounds the external lamina of individual muscle fibers
> nerve fibers and capillaries form a rich network in the endomysium bringing singles and oxygen to the muscle fibers

#### Cell level:
**Myofibre** elongated, highly differentiated cell
![](https://i.imgur.com/fShYyUS.png =350x)

#### Subcellular level:
**Inside the cell (myofiber):**
- **myofibril** bundle of myofilaments
- **myofilament** myosin and f-actin organized in a symmetric pattern

### Cross-striations are the principal histologic feature of striated muscle
**Striations** = alternating light and dark bands (I, A, H)
- **arise from myofibril organization; the arrangement of actin and myosin filaments**
- each myofibril consists of a long series of sarcomeres, separated by Z discs and containing thick and thin filaments that overlap in certain regions → critical for function (contraction)
**Z disc** (Ger. Zwischen,  inbetween): **attachment of thin actin filament**, actin-binding protein α-actinin and exhibit opposite polarity on each side of this disc 
**M line** (Ger. Mitte, middle):  containing a myosin-binding protein myomesin that **holds the thick myosin filaments in place** 
**Sarcomere: from Z disc to Z disc**

### How does muscle contract?
**Actomycin cross-bridge cycle stages:**
1. initial stage: myosin head attached
2. release
3. bending
4. force generation
    - ATP → ADP energy release
5. reattachment

### How does muscle receive a signal?
![](https://i.imgur.com/K43O40s.png =300x)
> can know this in more basic detail

1. acetylcholine released from the axon terminal binds to receptors on the sarcolemma
2. an action potential is generated and travels down the T tubule
3. Ca^2+^ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to the change in voltage
4. Ca^2+^ binds troponin, cross-bridges form between actin and myosin
5. acetylcholinesterase removes acetylcholine from the synaptic cleft
6. Ca^2+^ is transported back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum
7. tropomyosin binds active sites on actin causing the cross-bridge to detach

#### How do all myofibrils receive the signal simultaneously?
**T tubules** are sarcolemma intensions that penetrate deeply into the sarcoplasm
- arrange with sarcoplasmic reticulum in **triads**
- mediate the muscle action potential

## Medical association
**Muscle size**
- variation in diameter of muscle fibers depends on factors of an individual
    - e.g. muscle;
    - age
    - gender
    - nutritional status
    - physical training
- exercise enlarges the skeletal musculature by stimulating formation of new myofibrils and growth in the diameter of individual muscle fibers
**Aging**
- muscle fibers become smaller, less elastic, more fibrotic, lose tolerance for exercise, number satellite cells decreases → reduced ability to recover from injury
**Myasthenia gravis**
- autoimmune disorder involving circulating antibodies against proteins of acetylcholing receptors
    - antibody binding to the antigenic sites interferes with acetylcholine activation of their receptors, leading to intermittent periods of skeletal muscle weakness
- the extraocular muscles of the eyes are commonly the first affected

## 3 muscle types

### Cardiac muscle
**Myocytes** long cylindrical cells, 1 nucleus, centrally located
- often branch and join with cells in adjacent fibers forming tightly knit bundles of cells, interwoven in spiraling layers

**Intercalated disc** transverse line where cells join
- characteristic for cardiac muscle
- composed of many **desmosomes** and **fascia adherens** junctions, and **gap junctions**
![](https://i.imgur.com/rttx5dc.png =200x)

**Other**
- involuntary, rhythmic contractions
- rich blood supply
![](https://i.imgur.com/PflGsSM.png =200x)

#### Medical association
**Heart disease and ischemia**
- most common injury sustained by cardiac muscle is due to **ischemia** or tissue damage due to lack of oxygen when coronary arteries are occluded by heart disease
- adult mammalian cardiac muscle has little potential to regenerate after injury due to lacking muscle satellite cells

### Smooth muscle (visceral muscle)
**Small fusiform cells**
- 1 nucleus, elongated, centrally located

**Specialized for steady contractions of relatively low force**
- involuntary contraction

**Location: major component of blood vessels and of the digestive, respiratory, urinary, and reproductive tracts**

![](https://i.imgur.com/WxEFBHI.png =200x)
- in digestive tract, smooth muscle is organized in 2 layers
    - outer longitudinal layer (OL);
    - inner circular layer (IL)

#### Contraction
- no longitudinal organization of protein fibers
- bundles criss-cross the cell, insert into anchoring points (dense bodies)
![](https://i.imgur.com/P46dMdP.png =275x)

#### Clinical association
**Leiomyoma**
- benign tumors called **leiomyomas** commonly develop from smooth muscle fibers but are seldom problematic
- most frequently occur in walls of the uterus where they are called **fibroids**
    - they can become sufficiently large to produce painful pressure and unexpected bleeding
