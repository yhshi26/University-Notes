## Histology
> histological methods are used to study the detailed structures of tissues
> histology = the study of the microscopic structure of tissues

### Preparation of hisologic sections

> cannot reverse preparation of sections
- removal of tissue
- fixation (formaldehyde)
- dehydration in ascending alcohol series (50, 70, 90, 100%)
- clearing in xylene
- embedding in paraffin
- sectioning with the microtome (5μm)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/MnulsGb.png =200x)
- mounting on a slide

### Wholemount preparations
- some tissues can be dissected and mounted on a slide as a "wholemount preparation"
- e.g. the retina

### Staining
#### Of sections:
- removal of paraffin by xylene
- hydration in **descending series** of alcohol
- staining of sections
- mounting in mounting medium
#### Techniques:

- haemotoxylin and eosin (H and E):
    - nucleus → blue-lilac
    - cytoplasm → pink
    - muscle → red
    - red blood cells → red

## Microscopy
### Microscopic techniques
- **eyepiece** works in combination with microscope **objectives** to magnify specimens under the microscope
- **magnification** = eyepiece power * objective power
- objectives: 10x, 20x, 40x, 60x (eyepiece usually 10x)
### Magnification and resolution

### Challenges: interpretation of images
1. assessing the size of objects
2. variety of appearances may result from slicing 3D structures and examining in 2D planes
3. artifacts: characteristics which are there as a consequence of procedures used to prepare the tissue
    - tissue folding
    - chatter artifact
    - tissue tearing
    - bubbles
