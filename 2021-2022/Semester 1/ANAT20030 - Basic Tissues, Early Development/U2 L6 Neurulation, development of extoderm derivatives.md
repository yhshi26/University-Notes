> learning objectives: know details of development of various parts of brain and spinal cord; understand basic mechanism of neural patterning along the cranio-caudal and dorso-ventral axes; understand disorders of central nervous system embryogenesis

#### Early CNS development
- all major parts of CNS developed from a simple tube **(neural tube)**

## Neurulation
- neurulation: the formation of the primitive nervous system
- involves two processes:
    - **induction** of the **neural plate** followed by
    - **formation** of the **neural tube**
- neural plate is an **ectodermal** derivative: ectoderm in midline is induced to form **neuroectoderm** by the underlying **notocord** and surrounding tissue

### Formation of neural tube
- **neural plate** lies above the notochord in the midline dorsally
- neural plate rises up into **neural folds** along its length on each side (**neural groove** in midline)
- cells at crest of each fold separate to form **nerual crest** cells ebtween neural plate and surface ectoderm
- neural folds fuse together along length to form **neural tube**

- neural fold **elevation** and **fusion** involves bending at well-defined **hinge-points**
- 3 hinge points:
    - 1 median
    - 2 lateral
- bending at median hinge point elevates folds
- bending at lateral hing points achieves fusion

### Neural fold fusion
- not known exactly what forces drive fusion
- cell division very active in neuroepithelium
- differential growth may determine the lateral hinges and force tips of neural folds towards each other

## CNS development
- newly formed neural tube closes and forms three vesicles in the **cranial** (anterior) region:
    - **prosencephalon** (forebrain)
    - **mesencephalon** (midbrain)
    - **rhombencephalon** (hindbrain)
- extreme cranial end is called **lamina terminalis**
- caudal to these vesicles are cells which form spinal cord

### Subdivisions of primitive brain
- further paired vesicles grow from forebrain (**telencephalic** vesicles)
- original part of forebrain is called **diencephalon**
- midbrain remains unchanged
- hindbrain subdivides into a cranial **metencephalon** and caudal **myelencephalon**

### Derivatives of primitive brain
- telencephalic vesicles:
    - cerebral hemispheres
    - enclose **lateral ventricles**
- diencephalon:
    - thalamus
    - encloses **third ventricle**
- mesencephalon:
    - midbrain
    - encloses **cerebral aqueduct**
- metencephalon: 
    - pons and cerebellum
    - encloses **upper** part of **fourth ventricle**
- myelencephalon:
    - medulla oblongata
    - encloses **lower** part of **fourth ventricle**

#### Lateral view of vesicles
- limited spacing causes neural tube to bend at three flexures

### Mechanism of neural tube formation
- neural tube closure begins in cervical region and proceeds cranially and caudally
- temporarily leaves openings called **neuropores** at either end of tube (**anterior** and **posterior**; communicate with amniotic sac)

### Secondary neurulation
- only occurs in lower end of spinal cord
- here, neural tube forms from solid rod of neural tissue which **canalises (hollows out)** and links up with the rest of the neural tube

### Closure of neural tube
- day 25
    - cranial **(anterior)** neuropore closes
- day 25+2
    - caudal **(posterior)** neuropore closes

### Clinical notes
#### Failure of closure of neural tube
- open neural tube defects may occur
- failure of caudal part to close is called **spina bifida**
- failure of cranial part to close is called **anencephaly** (no brain formation)
- total failure is called **rachischisis**
- neural tube defects are relatively common
    - can be prevented by dietary supplementation (before and during pregnancy) with **folic acid**

#### Regression of spinal cord
"Caudal regression syndrome is a rare, neural tube defect characterized by an abnormal development of the caudal aspect of the vertebral column and the spinal cord., It results in neurological deficits ranging from bladder and bowel involvement to severe sensory and motor deficits in the lower limbs." (NCBI)

### CNS has obvious cranio-caudal pattern
- neural tube development involves formation of separate regions along its length
    - cranially: expands laterally; develops **flexures**
    - cadually: spinal cord: remains a relatively constant width/shape
- both give rise to segmental nerves (emerge at discrete points): regionally specified (involves Hox gene 'choreographers')
- other patterns of segmentation seen in bodies of vertebrates (e.g. vertebral column)

### "The Hox code"

### Spinal cord development
- **ependymal** (ventricular) layer lines central canal
- **mantle** (intermediate) layer becomes **grey matter** of spinal cord (primarily nerve cell bodies)
- **marginal** layer formed by neural processes and becomes **white matter** of spinal cord

### Dorsal-ventral patterning of neural tube
- **basal plates** produce voluntary **(somatic)** motor neurons
- **alar plates** produce neurons of sensory **(somatic)** pathways
- intermediate region **(sulcus limitans)** produces motor and sensory neurons of **vsiceral** (autonomic) pathways

#### Establishment of dorsal-ventral pattern
- surface ectoderm and roof plate produce growth factors called **bon morphogenetic proteins** (BMPs) (and Wnts) which **induces** sensory neuron formation and **inhibits** motor
- notochord and floor plate produce a transcription factor called **Shh** which **induces** motor neuron formation and **inhibits** sensory

### Neural crest
- special part of dorsal neural groove that is not incorporated into neural tube on closure
- neural crest material migraets away from tube and populates **many distant sites**

#### Fate of trunk neural crest
- neural crest migration to skin forms melanocytes
- those migrating ventrally form:
    - dorsal root ganglia and peripheral sensory neurons
    - schwann cells
    - autonomic (sympathetic) ganglia
    - ganglion cells of gut
    - cells of adrenal medulla

#### Fate of cranial neural crest
- cranial neural crest forms some bone of vault of skull and bone around eyes and ears
- all cranial nerve ganglion cells (PNS)
- mesenchyme of pharyngeal arches (bones as above, plus muscles and cartilage)

## Summary: ectoderm derivatives
- nervous system
- additional nerual crest cell derivatives (melanocytes, some skull bones, adrenal medulla)
- surface ectoderm (mainly epidermis of skin)
