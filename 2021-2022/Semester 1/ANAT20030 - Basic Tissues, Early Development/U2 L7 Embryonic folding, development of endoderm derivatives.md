> learning objectives: understand how embryonic folding occurs, recognise outcome of faulty folding, know the components derived from the endoderm and how they arise, explain development of primitive gut and its associated organs

## Embryonic folding
- carnegie stages of development

### Transverse (lateral) embryonic folding
- the **extra-embryonic yolk sac lining** (from hypoblast) is continuous with the **embryonic endoderm** (from epiblast)
![](https://i.imgur.com/WiAMZs8.png =300x)
- **with lateral folding, mesoderm is recruited to gut wall**
- lateral folding of the embryo completes the gut tube
![](https://i.imgur.com/eNQQHUW.png =350x)
- **splanchnic (visceral) mesoderm** is the mesodermal layer of the gut tube (and other internal organs, e.g. lungs)
- **somatic (parietal) mesoderm** lines the body cavity/internal body wall
![](https://i.imgur.com/w8g8YV3.png =150x)

### Longitudinal embryonic folding
- the developing **endoderm** is initially open to the yolk sac
- folding at both ends of embryo (cranio-caudal) and lateral folding at sides of embryo, bringing endoderm inside to form gut tube

#### Cranial fold (longitudinal)

#### Caudal fold (longitudinal)
![](https://i.imgur.com/8sfRBja.png =250x)

### Longitudinal embryonic folding
- folding shapes the **foregut** and **hindgut**
- the **cardiac** region is brought to the ventral side of the developing gut tube
- juxtaposition of extoderm and endoderm at:
    - oropharyngeal membrane: future mouth
    - cloacal membrane: future anus
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/PAjbUiD.png =350x)
- gut-associated organs begin to form as buds from the endoderm (e.g. thyroid gland, lung, liver, pancreas)
- midgut opening to yolk sac progressively narrows
![](https://i.imgur.com/qA2zFEU.png =350x)
- stomach bulge is visible, organ buds (lung, pancreas, liver) are visible and continue to grow
- connection of midgut to yolk sac reduced to **yolk stalk** and then a very thin **vitelline duct**

### Gut-associated organs

#### Allantois
- 'sausage-shaped' pouch form hindgut
- highly vascularised sac
- **early embryogenesis:** liquid waste collection (from developing bladder) and gas exchange via allantois
- **later embryogenesis:** waste molecules passed on to mother via placenta; allantois regresses (vasculature incorporated into umbilical cord)
![](https://i.imgur.com/EiPUHPW.png =250x)

## Result of embryonic folding
- **lateral + longitudinal folding =**
    - yolk sac and allantois outside embryo
    - gut tube within embryo

## Primitive gut 
### Endoderm derivative

### Blood supply
![](https://i.imgur.com/mgtq7AM.png =350x)

### Components 
- **(these three regions are defined by their blood supply)**
|    | gut tube proper | gut tube derivatives |
| -- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| foregut | pharynx, esophagus, stomach, proximal duodenum | thyroid, parathyroid glands, tympanic cavity, trachea/bronchi/lungs, liver/gallbladder/pancreas | 
| midgut | distal duodenum → right half of transverse column |  | 
| hindgut | left half of transverse column → anus | urinary bladder | 

### Gut openings
#### Anterior (cranial)

#### Posterior (caudal)

## Regional organogenesis
### Lungs and respiratory system
- trachea and lung buds derive from gut
- **oesophaegeal atresia** (OA) and **trachea-oesophageal fistula** (TOF) result from abnormal separation of trachea from oesophagus
- to be covered in respiratory biology next semester

### Liver and pancreas
- liver and pancrease arise in 4th week from foregut endoderm (duodenal region) in response to signals from nearby mesoderm
- pancreas has distinct ventral and dorsal components which fuse together

### Intestine
- at 25 days, gut is continuous with yolk sac via vitelline duct/yolk stalk
- intestine elongates rapidly and runs out of space in abdominal cavity → temporarily moves into umbilical cord (**physiological umbilical herniation**) at 6 weeks
![](https://i.imgur.com/rYG03cp.png =350x)
- to be covered in more detail in GI/liver biology (next year)

## Defects associated with gut herniation and rotation
### Ventral body wall defects
- if small part of intestine remains in umbilical cord (which is covered by skin) → **umbilical hernia**
    - very common (15-20% of nerborns)
    - usually regress but can require surgery
- failure of intestines to return to body following physiological umbilical herniation → **omphalocoele**
    - affects 1/4000 babies
    - 25% mortality
- if lateral body folding and fusion fails to occur properly during 4th-8th weeks, it creates a body wall weakness that allows the bowel to herniate later (usually on right side) → **gastroschisis**
    - affects 1/5000 babies
    - 90% recovery if treated

### Vitelline duct abnormalities
- **persistence of vitelline duct** can cause multiple abnormalities
- **meckel's diverticulum =** outpocket of ileum (persistent vitelline duct)
- attachments can twist **(volvulus)** and cause stenosis and ischaemia

### Development of hindgut
- **cloaca:** common uro-genital-rectal structure
    - connects anteriorly to allantois
    - connects posteriorly to hindgut
- mesoderm **(uro-rectal septum)** then separates into urogenital and rectal compartments
- **cloacal membrane** breaks down: openings for hindgut and urogenital tract
