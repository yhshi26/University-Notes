> learning objectives: know structural make-up of central nervous system; know compositional difference between grey and white matter; understand differences between sensory and motor pathways; know functions of meninges and ventricular system

## CNS: brain
- made up of cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem

### Lobes, gyri (folds) and sulci (furrows)

### Cerebellum
- latin for "little brain"
- located in posterior aspect of brain just below occipital lobes
- lies behind brain stem (midbrain, pons, medulla)
- bilaterally symmetrical (like cerebrum)
- functions in **coordination of movement**

### Brainstem
- connects narrow spinal cord to expended cerebral hemispheres
- made up of:
    - medulla oblongata
    - pons
    - midbrain

## Grey matter vs. white matter
- **grey matter:** rich in nerve **cell bodies** (surface of cerebral hemisphere [good blood supply], central portion of spinal cord)
- **white matter:** rich in nerve **processes** (axons): **myelinated** fibres give paler color

## Nuclei and tracts
- **nuclei:** groups of nerve **cell bodies** with similar anatomical connections and function
- **tracts:** groups of nerve **processes** with common connections and functions, following the same course (also called **fasciculus, penducle, lmniscus...**)
    - outside CNS = nerves

### Tracts
- **tracts:** usually named according to direction of impulses
    - e.g. corticospinal tract: from "cerebral cortex" to "spinal cord"
    - e.g. spinothalamic tract: from "spinal cord" to "thalamus"

#### Anatomy of spinal cord
- central grey matter: nerve cell bodies and fibres
- white matter: myelinated fibres (may be **ascending** or **descending**)
![](https://i.imgur.com/P8WHGc5.png =350x)
- **dorsal horns:** **receive** axons of **sensory (afferent)** neurons
- **ventral horns:** **send out** axons of **motor (efferent)** neurons

## Somatosensory system
- system of peripheral **receptors** and processing centres to produce **somatic** sensory **modalities** of:
    - touch (discriminative, non-discriminative)
    - temperature
    - proprioception (body position)
    - nociception (potentially injurious ('noxious') stimuli)
- system reacts to diverse **stimuli** through receptors, causing impulses to flow via sensory **(afferent)** nerves, through **tracts** in the spinal cord, and into the brain for processing
![](https://i.imgur.com/BLuU3O8.png =250x)
- in general, each cerebral hemisphere perceives sensations from, and ccontrols movements of, the **contralateral** side of the body (same side = **ipsilateral**)

### Organisation of sensory pathways
- for most somatic senses: sequence of **three** neurons between the receptor and perception of sensation at cerebral cortex
- **first order (primary) neuron:**
    - sends axon into cord or brainstem; cell body lies in a **ganglion**
- **second order (secondary) neuron:**
    - located in CNS; axon projects to thalamus **(contralateral)**
- **third order (tertiary) neuron:**
    - cell body is located in a specific thalamic **nucleus**; axon projects to a specific area of **ipsilateral** cerebral cortex **(primary somatosensory cortex)**
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/5IgenCP.png =250x)

### Organisation of motor pathways
- sequence of **two** neurons between cerebral cortex and effector (skeletal muscle
- **upper motor neuron:**
    - cell body located in motor cortex; axon projects via internal capsule to brainstem **(decussate)**; relays to ventral horn of spinal cord
- **lower motor neuron:**
    - cell body is located in ventral horn; axon projects to muscle unit

## CNS: protective structures:
- CNS supported and protected by bone (skull, vertebral column) and **membraneous coverings**
- the **meninges** are protective membranes that shelter the CNS
- the **cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)** is fluid that can act to cushion the CNS
- the brain also contains **ventricles** or spaces to absorb shock

### Meninges
- sing. "meninx" (gk. membrane)
- **brain** and **spinal cord** surrounded by 3 concentric membranous layers:
    - **dura mater** (dense, collagenous)
    - **arachnoid mater** ('spider'-like)
    - **pia mater** (delicate)
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/q0LLs6c.png =250x)

#### Meninges: function
- cover and protect CNS
- protect blood vessels and enclose **venous sinuses**
- contain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
- form partitions within the skull

#### Meninges and intracranial haemorrhage
- diagram: a) epidural haemorrhage, b) subdural haemorrhage, c) subarachnoid haemorrhage

## Ventricular system
- consists of 2 lateral ventricles and midline 3rd and 4th ventricles
- CSF secreted by **choroid plexus**
- ventricles, choroid plexuses and CSF essential for normal brain function

### Ventricles
- expanded cavities in forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain
- remnants of lumen from **embryonic neural tube**
- continuous with each other and central canal of spinal cord
- filled with CSF
- lined by **ependymal cells**

### Cerebrospinal fluid
- clear liquid
- found around brain and psinal cord
- similar to blood plasma in constitution
- provides nutrients
- cushions brain and spinal cord
- buoyancy
- pH
