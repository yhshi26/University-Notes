> learning objectives: delineate the organization of bone and how it relates to function, recognize different types of bone (woven, compact, spongy), describe the function of different bone cell types, explain how bone is formed and remodelled, describe the microscopic structure of the epiphyseal growth plate, give examples of bone pathologies and the underlying disease process

#### **Breakdown of cell and tissue composition of bones:**

## **Functions of bone and skeletal system:**

Bone is the primary tissue of the skeleton

Skeleton functions:

- support
- movement: muscle attachment
- protection: cavities and organs (e.g. skull)
- calcium homeostasis: constant exchange between blood and bones (for nerve conduction and muscle contraction)
- storage: stores red and yellow marrow
    - red marrow → haematopoiesis
    - Hematopoiesis is the formation of blood cellular components. All cellular blood components are derived from hematopoietic stem cells.

### **Structure of bone:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/4M9dUNW.png =250x)

Proximal to distal:

- epiphysis: ends of the long bone, articular surface
- diaphysis: long straight section between the ends of a long bone
- metaphysis: regions between epiphysis and diaphysis, contains epiphyseal (growth) plate

From outside to inside:

- articular cartilage (epiphysis)
- periosteum
- compact bone
- trabecular bone
- endosteum
- medullary (marrow) cavity

### **Important bone facts:**

- bone is alive and metabolically active!
- bone is an organ
- highly vascular (unlike cartilage)
- constantly being remodeled: balance between bone formation (osteoblasts) and bone resorption (osteoclasts)
- damaged bone is replaced by newly synthesized bone

## **Organization of bone:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/hL0LsjT.png =300x)

#### **Osteocytes in** **lacunae**

- lacunae connected to each other and blood vessels through canaliculi
- compact bone consist of osteons
- osteons are circular structures of
- concentric lamellae of bone matrix around a central canal
- haversian canal containing blood vessels and nerves.
- volkmann's canals: perforating canal connecting central canals, periosteum and marrow
- fibers in lamellae parallel but in different directions in next lamella conferring strength

#### **Periosteum: tough, vascularized, fibrous sheath that superficially covers bone where no cartilage exists**

- nourishes bone
- protects bone
- attachment site for ligaments and tendons
- superficial layer high on fibers
- deep layers have osteogenic (bone-forming) cells for bone repair

#### **Endosteum: thin membrane that lines the medullary cavity**
![](https://i.imgur.com/1IpFauW.png =300x)
- single layer of bone-forming (osteoprogenitor) cells
- sparse matrix of collagen fibers

**Medullary cavity: hollow cavity containing bone marrow.** 

- minimizes the weight of the bone where it is least needed

### **Composition of bone tissue: matrix**

**Organic matrix: dry weight 35%**

- type I collagen
- proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycan (GAGs)
- glycoproteins: osteonectin and osteocalcin

**Inorganic matrix: dry weight 65%**

- calcium phosphate - hydroxyapatite
- hardness, compressive strength

### **Composition of bone tissue: cells**

- osteoblasts are responsible for the production of new bone - a process called **osteogenesis**
- osteocytes maintain and monitor protein and mineral content of the matrix, signal stress
- osteoprogenitor cells differentiate from the mesenchyme, drivide to produce osteoblasts
- osteoclasts are large with multiple nuclei, are derived from monocytes, and dissolve the bone matrix releasing calcium in a process called **osteolysis**

**Cell types of bone: origin**

## **Types of bone:**

### **Woven bone:**

- immature bone (osteoid)
- random arrangement of collagen fibers
- first formed during fetal development or repair of fracture
- remodeled into lamellar bone
![](https://i.imgur.com/Hqi70KZ.png =125x)

### **Lamellar bone:**

- mature bone
- 2 types: 1) compact and 2) spongy
- concentric bands of collagen
- fibers are orientated in 1 direction in each layer, but each layer is in different directions → increases strength

> (note: virtually all bone in healthy adults is lamellar)

### **Compact bone - osteon:**

- also known as **haversian system**
- functional unit consisting of concentric lamellae
    - lacunae: spaces between concentric lamellae
    - canaliculi: small extracellular fluid-filled channels radiating from lacunae
    - haversian canal: neurovascular channels
    - perforating (volksman) canals: provide blood vessels and nerves from periosteum

### **Spongy (cancellous or trabecular) bone:**

- latticework of thin plates of bone called trabeculae oriented along lines of stress
- spaces between struts are filled wiht red marrow
- found in ends of long bones and inside flat bones such as hip bones, sternum and ribs
    
    **No osteons in trabecular bone**

## **Bone formation:**

1. Intramembranous ossification:
    - ossification within (intra) a membrane (~8 wks)
    - special cells (mesenchyme: embryonic connective tissue) secrete protein matrix that later mineralizes (becomes hard)
    - primarily flat and irregular bones (e.g. facial bones, skull)
2. Endochondral ossification
    - replacement of cartilage by bone (~12 wks)
    - mesenchyme turns into cartilage that is later replaced by bone
    - majority of bones in skeletal system
    - normally associated with growth in length (e.g. humerus, femur)

### Intremembranous ossification
- mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into osteoprogenitor cells, then osteoblasts
- osteoblasts surround themselves in bone matrix
- bone matrix is calcified into trabeculae with spaces containing red bone marrow
- periosteum develops
- outer layers of spongy bone are replaced with compact bone

### Endochondral ossification
![](https://i.imgur.com/ORbw5Of.png =300x)
#### Epiphyseal (growth) plate
**Zones:**
1. resting cartilage: consists of small, scattered chondrocytes
2. proliferating cartilage: larger chondrocytes, arranged like coins
3. hypertrophic cartilage: large maturing chondrocytes
4. calcified cartilage: dead chondrocytes in calcified cartilage
5. resorption
    - osteoclasts dissolve cartilage
    - osteoblasts and capillaries invade the area

### Appositional bone growth: increase in bone diameter

## Bone remodeling: 
> bone forms after birth but continually renews after formation

- old bone is resorbed by osteoclasts
- replaced with new osteoid, secreted by osteoblasts
- renewal rate for compact bone – 4% every year
- renewal rate for trabecular bone – 20% every year
- replace the whole skeleton every 7-10 years

**A balance between bone formation and resorption is crucial to maintain healthy bone**

## Bone pathology:

- post-fracture remodeling:
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/39aAsX6.png =250x)
    

**Bone pathologies:**

**Achondroplasia → without cartilage formation**

- affects endochondral ossification
- closure of epiphyseal plates before bones mature and normal bone
length is reached
- all people with achondroplasia have short stature
- bones derived from intramembranous ossification are not affected
    
    Characteristic features:
    
    - short upper arms and thighs
    - limited range of motion at the elbows
    - an enlarged head (macrocephaly) with a prominent forehead
    - fingers are typically short and the ring finger and middle finger may diverge, giving the hand a three-pronged (trident) appearance

**Osteopenia & osteoporosis → excessive bone resorption**

- typically affects older women
- excessive osteoclast activity & loss in bone density
- bones fracture more easily
- often patients may appear to be stooped
- bone density measured by DEXA Scan
    - patients receive a T-score
    - T-score is a measure of patients bone density vs. that of healthy 30 year old of same gender
    - -1 to -2.5 → Osteopenia
    - below -2.5 → Osteoperosis

**Osteopetrosis → excessive bone formation**

- umbrella term used to describe pathologies with increased bone density
- defective skeletal remodeling
- osteoclasts fail to resorb bone
- osteoblast activity continues without the counter-regulatory action of osteoclasts
- normal bone remodeling fails
- bones become very dense but also brittle
(remodeling confers strength!)
- => bones are much more brittle and fracture easily
