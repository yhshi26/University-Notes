> learning objectives: know timeline of implantation (including clinical relevance of incorrect implantation), know different staegs of embryonic development during implantation, understnd nutrition of conceptus

#### Fertilisation: recap
- must occur within 24h of ovulation
- sperm meets egg in uterine tube after capacitation
- acrosome reaction after binding to zon apellucida (dissolves a path)
- membranes fuse: zona reaction (preventions polyspermy)
- triggers oocyte to complete meiosis
- pronuclei fuse: disploid zygote

- chromosomes become arranged on a cleavage spindle in preparation for cleavage of the zygote
- cleavage pattern follows:

#### Cleavage: early development
- mitotic divisions of zygote: **cleavage** divisions (parent cell cleaved in half, i.e. daughter cells **[blastomeres]** reduced in size)
- solid ball of cells called **morula** is formed
- becomes **blastula,** and blastula cavity forms; zona pellucida breaks down ("hatches"): embryo begins to grow in size
- two cell massses form:
    - **embryoblast** (inner cell mass): **one layered embryo stage**
    - **trophoblast** (outer cell mass)

## Early embryonic development
- regulated series of mitotic divisions not accompanied by growth

### Embryonic stem cells
- embryonic stem cells **(ES cells)** are **pluripotent** stem cells derived from inner cell mass of **blastocyst** (early-stage, pre-implantation embryo)
    - can give rise to all cell types within body

## Female reproductive system: anatomy

### Hatching blastocyst
- pre-requisite for implantation

### Implantation
![](https://i.imgur.com/ef3aTVA.png =450x)

#### Day 5
- blastocyst hatches from zona pellucida
- implantation into uterine endometrium, which has undergone a **decidual reaction** (increase in secretory functions of endometrium)
- hCG = human chorionic gonadotrophin
    - from trophoblast
    - basis of pregnancy test
- diagram: ectopic pregnancies

#### Day 6
- blastocyst attaches to endometrium (at embryonic pole)
- trophoblast starts to proliferate rapidly
![](https://i.imgur.com/spWSt6f.png =250x)

#### Day 6-7
- 2 layers formed from trophoblast:
    - **syncytiotrophoblast** (outer): infiltrates cells of endometrium, forms a multinucleated protoplasmic mass, no clear cell boundaries; finger-like processes invade connective tissue (enzymes erode maternal tissue)
    - **cytotrophoblast** (inner)

#### Day 7
- at 7 days, a layer of cells appears on surface of embryoblast adjacent to blastocyst cavity **(hypoblast)**
    - later becomes **endoderm**
- syncytiotrophoblast continues eroding endometrium to embed blastocyst

#### Day 8
- decidual cells adjacent to syncytiotrophoblast start degenerating
- engulfed by syncytiotrophoblast: rich source of embryonic nutrition
- syncytiotrophoblast strats to produce hCG (enough by end 2md week for +ve pregnancy test)
![](https://i.imgur.com/4isW1nT.png =250x)
- small space starts to appear in embryoblast (amniotic cavity)
- embryoblast starts forming **embryonic disc** composed of two layers:
    - **epiblast** (thicker, adjacent to amniotic cavity; later ectoderm)
    - **hypoblast** (adjacent to exoelomic cavity)

#### Day 9
- embryo completely implanted in uterine endometrium
- amniotic cavity expanding, primary umbilical vescle (yolk sac) expanding
- coagulation plug in endometrial surface
- cells from vesicle lining form **extraembryonic mesoderm**
![](https://i.imgur.com/2gXtwJL.png =250x)
- concurrently, **lacunae** (small spaces) appear in syncytiotrophoblast
    - become filled with maternal blood from ruptured capillaries, cell debris
- passes to embryonic disc (diffusion) for nutrition
- primordium of uteroplacental circulation

#### Day 10-11
- conceptus completely embedded in endometrium
- communication of blood-filled lacunar networks
![](https://i.imgur.com/3e2fzow.png =250x)

#### Day 11-12
- lacunar networks later form intervillous spaces of placenta
- endometrial capillaries dilate to form sinusoids
- erosion by syncytiotrophoblast allows maternal blood to flow to lacunar networks
- nutritive fluid absorbed by trophoblast, transferrred to embryo
![](https://i.imgur.com/M0zvqu6.png =250x)
- concurrently, size of extraembryonic mesoderm increases
- spaces (extraembryonic coelomic spaces) start to form within extraembryonic mesoderm and rapidly fuse

#### Day 12-13
- forms **extraembryonic coelom** (isolate cavity)
- fluid-filled, expands to surround amnion and primary umbilical vesicle, expect where attached to chorion at connecting stalk 
- the extraembryonic coelom splits the extraembryonic mesoderm into two layers:
    - extraembryonic somatic mesoderm
    - extraembryonic splanchinic mesoderm
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/yVVXaR1.png =250x)
- primary vesicle decreases in size
- a secondary vesicle forms: this will be the **yolk sac**
- functions of yolk sac:
    - haematopoiesis
    - protein synthesis
    - nutrition

## Nutrition of the conceptus
### Week 1
- lives off nutrients stored in ovum
- hatches
- blastocyst enlargens by incorportation of secretions from uterine glands
- implants
- nutrition and elimination by simple diffusion

### Week 2
- from day 9: development of the utero-placental circulation
    - vacuoles develop in the syncytiotrophoblast =
        - trophoblastic lacunae
    - nearby maternal capillaries expand = 
        - maternal sinusoids (blood vessels)

## Uteroplacental circulatory system
- development of placental villi (columns with syncytial coverings)
- grow into syncytiotrophoblast
    - exchange of gases, waste between fetal and maternal systems

## Implantation: overview
- **two-layered embryo** formed from embryoblast during implantation (forerunners of 2 embryonic grem layers)
    - **hypoblast** (primitive **endoderm**)
    - **epiblast** (primitive **ectoderm**)
- long axis of oval-shaped disc will become cranio-caudal axis of body
    - dorsal-ventral axis also established
