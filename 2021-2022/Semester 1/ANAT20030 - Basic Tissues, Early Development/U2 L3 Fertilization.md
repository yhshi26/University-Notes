## Fertilization
- uion of sperm and oocyte
- site of fertilization: **ampulla (oviduct)**

### Process of fertilization
- **after ovulation:**
    - vital COCs attach
    - degenerated COCs float
- **after insemination:**
    - spermatozoa bound in sperm reservoir
    - spermatozoa stay motile
        - sperm have to swim against a current
    - sperm are transported by smooth muscle contraction (prostaglandings)
        - sperm must reach middle of the lumen
- **sperm oviduct interaction:**
    - sperm form apserm reservoir: 3-4 days
    - spermien bind temporarily: 2 sec-1 min
    - sperm compete 
- **fertilization:**
    - as soon as oocyte is in ampulla, spermatozoa detach
    - only very few sperm reach site of fertilization
    - only 1 spermatozoon gets into the oocyte
    - prerequisites for sperm to fertilize: capacitation
        - complex biochemical process: removal of glycoproteins and seminal proteins from surface of sperm acrosome
            - acrosome reaction occurs when sperm contact the zona pellucida (ZP) of the oocyte
            - enables penetration of ZP
            - characterized b cocurrence of vesicles on plasma membrane
            - release of enzymes (acrosine, hyaluronidase)
        - takes place in female genital tract
        - induced by glycosaminoglycans from follicular fluid, oviduct, uterus
    - prerequisites for oocyte to be fertilized: maturation
        - fetus: oocyte in prophase I
        - folliculogenesis: continuation of meiosis
        - ovulation: meiosis I finished
- **in vitro:**
    - spermatozoa move aimlessly

### The early embryo
- the embryonic tarnsport in the oviduct is retarded

## Phases of fertilization
- passage of sperm through corona radiata of the oocyte
- penetration of the zone pellucida
- fusion of th eplasma cell membranes of sperm and oocyte
- completion of meiosis II of oocyte
- exocytosis of cortical granules: structural change of ZP (inhibition of polyspermy)
- formation of female pronucleus
- formation of male pronucleus (degeneration of sperm tail)
- breakdown of pronuclear membranes: fusion (formation of **zygote**)

## Early embryogenesis
- cleavage
    - 4-cell stage: totipotency
    - 8-cell stage: pluripotency
    - morula: compaction
    - blastocyst

### Blastocyst formation
- day 4:
    - 8 cells
    - 8 cells compacted
- day 5:
    - 16 cells
- day 6-7:
    - blastocyst
    - cells inside cyst gather to one place
- blastocyst:
    - inner cell mass = embryoblast:
        - and some extraembryonic tissues
        - source of embryonic stem cells
    - trophoblast:
        - extraembryonic tissues: embryonic membranes
    - blastocoel:
        - blastocystic cavity
        - a space of future yolk sac

### Early embryogenesis in uterine tube
- prerequisite for implantation: hatching of blastocyst

## Clinical aspects
### In vitro fertilisation (IVF)
1. hormonal stimulation with FSH and GnRH agonist/antagonist
2. oocyte pick up (OPU)
3. in vitro fertilisation (IVF)
4. in vitro culture (IVC)
5. cryopreservation
6. embryo transfer (ET) d2 or d5

### Preimplantation diagnostics (PID)
- removal of one embryonic cell
- diagnosis of genetic defects by methods of molecular biology
- contra:
    - design baby
    - eugenics
- pro:
    - only healthy embryos transferred to uterus
    - fewer abortions
