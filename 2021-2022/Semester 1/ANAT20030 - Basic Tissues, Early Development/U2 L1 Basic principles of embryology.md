## What is embryology?
- embryology = study of embryos
    - branch of biology and medicine concerned with studying prenatal development of **embryos** (up to 8 weeks) and **fetuses** (9 weeks to birth)

### Why study embryology?
- provides developmental basis for anatomy of human body
- helps understand causes and variations in human anatomy and structure
- explains how normal and abnormal structures and relatins develop

### Related fields
- **developmental anatomy:** structural changes of a person from fertilisation to adulthood (includes embryology, fetology, and postnatal development)
- **teratology:** division of embryology and pathology that deals with abnormal development (birth defects)

### Aim of embryology component
- to gain an overview of **early embryogenesis** to **facilitate further studies in organogenesis and anatomical structure**
- lecture topics:
    - basic principles, incl. cell division
    - spermatogenesis and oogenesis
    - fertilisation
    - early development, implantatin
    - gastrulation (and mesoderm derivatives)
    - neurulation (and ectoderm derivatives)
    - embryonic folding (and endoderm derivatives)
    - branchial arches and cranial development

## Phases of embryogenesis
- **gametogenesis:** formation of gametes (egg and sperm)
- **fertilisation:** joining of gametes to form zygote
- **cleavage:** series of rapid cell divisions forming the **morula** (solid ball of cells) followed by **blastocyst** (hollow ball of cells with central cavity)
- **gastrulation:** rearrangement of cells into three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm
- **embryonic folding:** lateral and longitudinal folding of embryo
- **organogenesis:** formation of organ structures and systems

## Embryonic and fetal periods
- **embryonic period:** first 8 weeks, period of **embryogenesis** (also called **organogenesis**)
    - characterised by formation of most major body systems
    - **most critical period in which problems can arise**
- **fetal period:** from 8 weeks onwards; body grows larger, system begin to function

### Process begins at fertilisation
- human pregnancy normally lasts **38 weeks** (from conception (fertilisation) to birth)
    - at fertilisation, a single-celled **zygote** is formed by union of sperm and oocyte

## Cell division
- cell division in the embryo, and all **somatic cells**, occurs by **mitosis**
    - **somatic cell** = any cell of body **except** for cells that form sperm and oocyte
    - **germ cell** = any cell that gives rise to gametes of an organism that reproduces sexually

### Mitosis and meiosis: basic genetics
- each **somatic cell** in the human body contains 2 **different sets** (**diploid:** one from each parent) of **23** chromosomes = 46 chromosomes
- **N-number =** total number of copies of each unique double-stranded DNA molecule
- sex chromosomes:
    - **XX** in female
    - **XY** in male

#### Basic genetics
- reproductive **(germ)** cells (which form oocytes and sperm) contain just 23 chromosomes (i.e. **1 set, haploid** number)
    - these combine at fertilisstion to develop a new person with **different** genetic material to parents
    - after fertilisation: 23 pairs of chromosomes (**2 sets,** diploid) again
- **chromatid:** either of the two daughter strands of a **replicated** chromosome that are joined by a single centromere and separated during cell division to become individual chromosomes

#### Mitosis
- process of cell division in which one cell becomes **two identical daughter cells**
![](https://i.imgur.com/QJ0Hbi9.png =350x)

##### M phase (mitosis/cytokinesis)
1. prophase
2. metaphase
3. anaphase
4. telophase
5. cytokinesis (separate)

##### Mitosis and meiosis steps
![](https://i.imgur.com/x5zX4hp.png =250x)

#### Meiosis
- **reduction division:** number of chromosomes per cell cut in half (2N â†’ N)
![](https://i.imgur.com/0zkB5SQ.png =350x)
- necessary to **halve** number of chromosomes going into sex cells (gametes)
    - at fertilisation, male and female gamtes will provide **1/2 of needed chromosomes** each, such that offspring has chromosomes from each parent
- **purpose/function:**
    1. replicate chromosomes
    2. shuffle genetic information
    3. divide to produce haploid (N) cells
    - (note errors an occur, e.g. trisomy 21/down syndrome)
    
## Embryonic body axis development
- during grastrulation, the three cardinal body axes are established:
    1. **cranio-caudal** axis: established while embryo is still a flat sheet/disc of cells
    2. **dorso-ventral** axis: established as embryo folds
    3. **medio-lateral** axis

### Germ layers: preview
- **ectoderm:** epidermis structures (e.g. skin, nails, hair), nervous system (neural crest and neural tube)
- **mesoderm:** muscle, connective tissue, blood, blood vessels, skeleton, reproductive and urinary systems
- **endoderm:** epithelium lining digestive and respiratory tracts, digestive organs such as liver and pancreas

### Basis of morphogenesis: cellular processes

#### Example: nerual tube formation
- all major parts of CNS developed from a simple tube **(neural tube)**
- diagram: neurulation (formation of neural tube)

### Embryonic period
- highly controlled sequences of events
- many different factors involved
    - timing, positioning, patterning, progress and precision of cellular activities are all important in this sequence of events
    - genetic inputs, signalling factors, cell receptor activity, chemoattractants, transcription factors, growth factors, adhesion molecules, etc. etc. involved as well
- **i.e. a very precarious balance of activities where a lot can go wrong**

## Development is progressive
- embryonic development in generative: each step is built upon the previous step
- usually, reliable mechanism consistent to maintaining the species
- but can go wrong if:
    - gene not inherited properly (mutation)
    - misencoded gene inherited and expressed
    - exogenous substance **(teratogen)** interferes with developmental process

### Congenital abnormalities
- 2-3% of babies born with significant **developmental defect** detectable at birth
    - can be serious malformations or can be variations with little or no clinical significance
    - cause of 50% all congenital abnormalities unknown
    - teratogens alone induce up to 10% all anomalies
    - genetic abnormalities induce up to 15-25%
    - interaction of both (environmental and genetic): an additional 15-25% (multi-factorial)

#### Genetic mutations
- genetic mutations of single genes or aberrant genetic expression has been documented to cause abnormal development
- e.g. achondroplasia (FGFR2), polydactyly (FGF)

#### Teratogens and critical period
- embryos are vulnerable to certain agents that have negligible or non-toxic effect so n adult individuals
    - medications, e.g. thalidomide
    - alcohol, tobacco, caffeine
    - environmental chemicals
    - viral infection
- embryonic structure susceptible only during specific critical periods
    - usually corresponding to periods of active differentiation and morphogenesis
- teratogenesis is dependent on dose of teratogen
- susceptibility to teratogen depends on genetic constitution

##### Thalidomide
- used as sedative drug in 1950s-60s in Europe, Canada, Australia and Asia
- low toxicity in adults
- prescribed to pregnant women to treat nausea and vomtiing due to morning sickness
- estimated 10K children born with major malformations
